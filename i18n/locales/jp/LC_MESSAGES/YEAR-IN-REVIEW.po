msgid "2023 is probably [the year of AI](https://journal.everypixel.com/2023-the-year-of-ai), with millions of people jumping aboard [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) train. matrix-docker-ansible-deploy is no stranger to this and 2023 began with a PR from [bertybuttface](https://github.com/bertybuttface) who added support for [matrix-chatgpt-bot](https://github.com/matrixgpt/matrix-chatgpt-bot) (see the [changelog entry](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/850078b7e37401ce91a0f9b686f60b945f6c3a96/CHANGELOG.md#chatgpt-support)). While OpenAI's chat GPT website was frequently overloaded in the past, their API was up which made using this bot both convenient and more reliable."

msgid "AI aside, with the playbook's focus being containers, we're **doubling down on being \"container native\"** and becoming more interoperable for people hosting other containers on the Matrix server. In [2022](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/850078b7e37401ce91a0f9b686f60b945f6c3a96/YEAR-IN-REVIEW.md#2022), we've announced a few sibling Ansible playbooks, their use of [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) and the possiblity of matrix-docker-ansible-deploy also switching to this reverse-proxy. This prediction materialized quickly. The **largest change** in the playbook in 2023 happened way back in February - matrix-docker-ansible-deploy [starting the switch from nginx to Traefik](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/850078b7e37401ce91a0f9b686f60b945f6c3a96/CHANGELOG.md#backward-compatibility-reverse-proxy-configuration-changes-and-initial-traefik-support) and then quickly [making Treafik the default reverse-proxy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/850078b7e37401ce91a0f9b686f60b945f6c3a96/CHANGELOG.md#traefik-is-the-default-reverse-proxy-now). As noted in the changelog entries, we envisioned a quick and complete elimination of `matrix-nginx-proxy`, but at the end of 2023, it hasn't happened yet. The playbook is already using Traefik as the front-most reverse-proxy, but nginx (via `matrix-nginx-proxy`) is still around - it has taken a step back and is only used internally for new setups. Work got to a stall due to:"

msgid "complexity: untangling the overly large and messy `matrix-nginx-proxy` component is difficult"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../YEAR-IN-REVIEW.md:10
msgid "the current setup became \"good enough\" because nginx has become an internal implementation detail for those who have migrated to Traefik. Traefik is already the default public reverse-proxy and gives better possibilities to people wishing to run other web-exposed containers on their Matrix server via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), other Ansible playbooks like [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) (more about this one, below) or any other way."

msgid "`matrix-nginx-proxy` is no longer in the way of us being interoperable, but its ugly internal details are still there. It is one more proxy in the long chain of reverse-proxies we have and we'd like to cut it out. This would both make things simpler and also boost performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../YEAR-IN-REVIEW.md:14
msgid "The delay in eliminating `matrix-nginx-proxy` has probably been welcome by many existing users who decided to postpone the Traefik migration a bit longer. In 2024, work on eliminating `matrix-nginx-proxy` will continue with rapid pace. People who are still using `matrix-nginx-proxy` as their front-most reverse-proxy will need to rework their setup. About a year of putting it off has been long enough."

#: ../../../YEAR-IN-REVIEW.md:16
msgid "This large Traefik reverse-proxy change was also accompanied by another internal change which began in 2022, but continued in 2023 - **moving non-Matrix-related roles from being internal to the playbook to living their own life outside of it**. Various roles were made more decoupled and moved outside of the playbook, so that other projects (like the [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) Ansible playbook or other Ansible playbooks) could benefit from them. This led to the **death of a few sibling playbooks** ([gitea-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/gitea-docker-ansible-deploy), [nextcloud-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/nextcloud-docker-ansible-deploy), [peertube-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/peertube-docker-ansible-deploy), [vaultwarden-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/vaultwarden-docker-ansible-deploy)), but brought life to something better, which supports all these services and more."

msgid "[mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) is a new Ansible playbook that a few of us (matrix-docker-ansible-deploy contributors) have launched in 2023. It has quickly grown to supports [60+ services](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/supported-services.md) and aims to do the same for [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) service hosting, as matrix-docker-ansible-deploy has done for Matrix - providing a clean and secure way to run a bunch of services in containers on a regular server (that is to say, without Kubernetes, etc.). Thanks to Traefik and Ansible role reuse, it's easy to host both mash-playbook services and matrix-docker-ansible-deploy services on the same server - see mash-playbook's [interoperability](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/interoperability.md) documentation page. If you've been looking for a holiday project or your New Year's Resolutions list contains \"self-hosting more services\", then you're welcome to give this new playbook a try and join its Matrix room ([#mash-playbook:devture.com](https://matrix.to/#/#mash-playbook:devture.com))."

msgid "Because many of the roles are now external to this playbook (defined in the [requirements.yml](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/da27655ef34999fa924bc0a5e641dbd9ba06f133/requirements.yml) file), running `make roles` (or better yet `just roles` via the [just tool](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/850078b7e37401ce91a0f9b686f60b945f6c3a96/CHANGELOG.md#support-for-running-commands-via-just)) becomes a necessity each time one pulls playbook updates (`git pull`). Pulling external roles happens via the [ansible-galaxy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-galaxy.html) command-line tool, but if available, the playbook would also use the much faster [agru](https://github.com/etkecc/agru) tool (developed by [Aine](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc) from [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) this year)."
