With the introduction of Matrix Spaces, you can reorganize your flow around spaces — you can auto-join your users to a Matrix Space (via Synapse's `auto_join_rooms` setting — controlled by our `matrix_synapse_auto_join_rooms` variable), then add a bunch of rooms to the space and make them joinable by people belonging to the space. That is to say, do not make rooms public and do not publish them to the room directory unless they are really public. Instead, use other mechanisms for semi-public rooms or private rooms. One alternative is to stick to what you're doing (public rooms published to your rooms directory) but having a `m.federate: true` flag set during creation (clients like Element Web have a nice UI checkbox for this) to explicitly disable federation for them."

We don't want `matrix-nginx-proxy` to have a monopoly on port `80`/`443` and make it hard for other services to join in on the party.

Exposing these services to the web requires ugly hacks and configuration files being dropped into `/matrix/nginx-proxy/conf.d`.

Node-exporter and Postgres-exporter roles were advising for more `stats.example.com` usage in manual ways. Each role was doing things differently and mixing variables from other roles.
