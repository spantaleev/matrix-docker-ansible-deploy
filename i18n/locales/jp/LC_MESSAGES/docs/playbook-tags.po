msgid "The Ansible playbook's tasks are tagged, so that certain parts of the Ansible playbook can be run without running all other tasks."

msgid "Here are some playbook tags that you should be familiar with:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:9
msgid "`setup-all` - runs all setup tasks (installation and uninstallation) for all components, but does not start/restart services"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:11
msgid "`install-all` - like `setup-all`, but skips uninstallation tasks. Useful for maintaining your setup quickly when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove components, you'd need to run `setup-all` though, or these components will still remain installed"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:13
msgid "`setup-SERVICE` (e.g. `setup-postmoogle`) - runs the setup tasks only for a given role, but does not start/restart services. You can discover these additional tags in each role (`roles/**/tasks/main.yml`). Running per-component setup tasks is **not recommended**, as components sometimes depend on each other and running just the setup tasks for a given component may not be enough. For example, setting up the [mautrix-telegram bridge](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-telegram.md), in addition to the `setup-mautrix-telegram` tag, requires database changes (the `setup-postgres` tag) as well as reverse-proxy changes (the `setup-nginx-proxy` tag)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:15
msgid "`install-SERVICE` (e.g. `install-postmoogle`) - like `setup-SERVICE`, but skips uninstallation tasks. See `install-all` above for additional information."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:17
msgid "`start` - starts all systemd services and makes them start automatically in the future"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:19
msgid "`stop` - stops all systemd services"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:21
msgid "`ensure-matrix-users-created` - a special tag which ensures that all special users needed by the playbook (for bots, etc.) are created"

msgid "**Notes**:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/playbook-tags.md:24
msgid "`setup-*` tags and `install-*` tags **do not start services** automatically, because you may wish to do things before starting services, such as importing a database dump, restoring data from another server, etc."

msgid "Please be careful not to confuse the playbook tags with the `just` shortcut commands (\"recipes\"). For details about `just` commands, see: [Running `just` commands](just.md)"
