#: ../../../docs/faq.md:21
msgid "[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is a new type of realtime communication (chat) network, the closest analogy to which is probably \"email\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:23
msgid "You don't just use the \"email\" protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) directly though. There's a *server* somewhere which stores your data (`@gmail.com`, `@yahoo.com`, `@hotmail.com`, `@your-company.com`) and you access it by using these \"email\" protocols via some *client* program (Outlook, Thunderbird, some website, etc)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:25
msgid "In the world of the Matrix chat protocol, there are various client programs. The first and currently most full-featured one is called [Element](https://element.io/) (used to be called Riot.im and Vector.im in the past). There are [many other clients](https://matrix.org/clients/). You can switch clients as much as you want until you find the one that is right for you on a given platform (you may use Element Desktop on your desktop, but Fluffychat on your phone, etc)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:27
msgid "Matrix is also like email due to the fact that there are many servers around the world which can all talk to each other (you can send email from `@gmail.com` addresses to `@yahoo.com` and `@hotmail.com` addresses). It's the same with Matrix (`@bob:example.com` can talk to `@alice:example.org`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:29
msgid "If someone else is hosting your Matrix server (you being `@alice:matrix.org` or some other public server like this), all you need is a Matrix client program, like Element Web or Element X Android."

msgid "How do I get started with Matrix?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:51
msgid "One of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)'s distinguishing strengths (compared to other chat networks) is its decentralized nature. There's not just one entity (company, organization) controlling the servers. Rather there's thousands of servers operated by different people — one server being insecure, slow or disrespective toward its users does not affect the rest of the network. To participate in that decentralization in its fullest, consider hosting your own server or using some public server other than the largest/default one (`matrix.org`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:53
msgid "There are 3 ways to get into Matrix, depending on your technical ability and needs:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:55
msgid "**using the existing default server** — the easiest way is to use an existing server. The largest public Matrix server is `matrix.org` and it's configured as a default server in clients such as [Element Web](https://app.element.io) and many others. Just use Element Web on the browser via that link (or [download client apps for your Desktop or smartphone](https://element.io/app-for-productivity)), create an account and start chatting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:57
msgid "**using some other server** — instead of using the largest public server (`matrix.org`), you can use another public one. Here's a [list of public Matrix servers](https://joinmatrix.org/servers/) to choose from. Go to [Element Web](https://app.element.io) or download [some other client](https://matrix.org/clients/) of your choosing and adjust the homeserver URL during login."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:59
msgid "**using your own server** — running your own server puts you in ultimate control of your data. It also lets you have your own user IDs (e.g. `@bob:example.com`). See [How do I set up my own Matrix server](#how-do-i-set-up-my-own-matrix-server)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:61
msgid "How do I set up my own Matrix server?"

msgid "Normally, you'd first choose the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) server software you'd like to run. At the time of this writing (January/2021), there's only one fully-featured server program, so there's only one reasonable choice. That's [Synapse](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:73
msgid "[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an automation program. This \"playbook\" is a collection of tasks/scripts that will set up a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) server for you, so you don't have to perform these tasks manually."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:85
msgid "[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) is a modern command-runner alternative to [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). It can be used to invoke commands with less typing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:87
msgid "The `just` utility executes shortcut commands (called \"recipes\"), which invoke `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-galaxy` or [`agru`](https://github.com/etkecc/agru) (depending on what is available in your system). The targets of the recipes are defined in [`justfile`](../justfile)."

msgid "Reading the documentation of this Ansible playbook, you may also be thinking:"
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't know what [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is. I don't know what [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is. This looks more complicated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:101
msgid "… so you may be leaning toward [installing Synapse manually](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:103
msgid "The problem with a manual installation is:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:105
msgid "Synapse is written in Python. If not packaged for your distribution, you'd need to install various Python modules, etc., and keep them updated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:106
msgid "Synapse requires a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database (it can run on SQLite, but that's very much discouraged). So you'd need to install Postgres as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:107
msgid "you may also need a reverse-proxy server in front of it (nginx, Apache), so you'd need to be familiar with that"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:108
msgid "SSL is required, so you'd need to obtain Let's Encrypt (or other free or non-free) certificates for one or more domain names. You'd need to be familiar with [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) (when using Let's Encrypt) or similar software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:109
msgid "for each additional component you'd like to add (client like [Element](https://element.io), bridge to some other chat network, integration manager (stickers, other services, Identity Manager, etc.), you'll need to spend extra time installing and wiring it with the rest of the system in a way that works."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:110
msgid "you'll likely get slower updates for all of these components, depending on your distro packaging or your own time and ability"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:112
msgid "The playbook, on the other hand, installs a bunch of components for you by default, obtains SSL certificates for you, etc. If you'd like, you can enable various bridges and other services with very little effort. All the components are wired to work together."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:114
msgid "All services run in Docker containers (most being officially provided by each component's developers), so we're not at the mercy of distro packaging."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:116
msgid "Why use this playbook and not just use the Docker image directly?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:118
msgid "Reasons are similar to the reasons for not installing manually."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:120
msgid "Besides Synapse, you'd need other things — a Postgres database, likely the [Element](https://element.io) client, etc., etc."

#: ../../../docs/faq.md:130
msgid "This is similar to the [EMnify/matrix-synapse-auto-deploy](https://github.com/EMnify/matrix-synapse-auto-deploy) Ansible deployment, but:"
msgstr ""
