msgid "**WARNING**: Enabling the dashboard on a hostname you use for something else (like `matrix_server_fqn_matrix` in the configuration above) may cause conflicts. Enabling the Traefik Dashboard makes Traefik capture all `/dashboard` and `/api` requests and forward them to itself. If any of the services hosted on the same hostname requires any of these 2 URL prefixes, you will experience problems. So far, we're not aware of any playbook services which occupy these endpoints and are likely to cause conflicts."

msgid "The preferred way to reverse-proxy additional services behind Traefik would be to start the service as another container, configure the container with the corresponding Traefik [container labels](https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/) (see [Traefik & Docker](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/docker/)), and connect the service to the `traefik` network. Some services are also already available via the compatible [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook), but take a look at the minor [interoperability adjustments](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/interoperability.md)."

If you do so, bear in mind the security implications of disabling the certificate validity checks towards your back end."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-playbook-traefik.md:91
msgid "Next, you have to add a new dynamic configuration file for Traefik that contains the actual information of the server using the `aux_file_definitions` variable. In this example, we will terminate SSL at the Traefik instance and connect to the other server via HTTPS. Traefik will now take care of managing the certificates."
