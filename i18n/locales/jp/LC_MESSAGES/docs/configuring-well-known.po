msgid "There are 3 types of well-known service discovery mechanism that Matrix makes use of:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:9
msgid "(important) **Federation Server discovery** (`/.well-known/matrix/server`) -- assists other servers in the Matrix network with finding your server. With the default playbook configuration specified on the sample `vars.yml` ([`examples/vars.yml`](../examples/vars.yml)), this is necessary for federation to work. Without a proper configuration, your server will effectively not be part of the Matrix network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:11
msgid "(less important) **Client Server discovery** (`/.well-known/matrix/client`) -- assists programs that you use to connect to your server (e.g. Element Web), so that they can make it more convenient for you by automatically configuring the \"Homeserver URL\" and \"Identity Server URL\" addresses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:13
msgid "(optional) **Support service discovery** (`/.well-known/matrix/support`) -- returns server admin contact and support page of the domain."

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:17
msgid "All services created by this playbook are meant to be installed on their own server (such as `matrix.example.com`), instead of the base domain (`example.com`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:19
msgid "As [per the Server-Server specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html#server-discovery), in order to use a short Matrix user ID like `@alice:example.com` instead of `@alice:matrix.example.com` while hosting services on a subdomain such as `matrix.example.com`, the Matrix network needs to be instructed of [server delegation](howto-server-delegation.md) / redirection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:21
msgid "For simplicity reasons, this playbook recommends you to set up server delegation via a `/.well-known/matrix/server` file."

msgid "If you set up the DNS SRV record for server delegation instead, take a look at this documentation for more information: [Server Delegation via a DNS SRV record (advanced)](howto-server-delegation.md#server-delegation-via-a-dns-srv-record-advanced)"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:29
msgid "This lets you (and your users) easily connect to your Matrix server without having to customize connection URLs. When using client programs that support it, you won't need to point them to `https://matrix.example.com` in Custom Server options manually anymore. The connection URL would be discovered automatically from your full username."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:31
msgid "Without /.well-known/matrix/client, the client will make the wrong \"homeserver URL\" assumption (it will default to using https://example.com, and users will need to notice and adjust it manually (changing it to https://matrix.example.com)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:33
msgid "As [per the Client-Server specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#server-discovery) Matrix does Client Server service discovery using a `/.well-known/matrix/client` file hosted on the base domain (e.g. `example.com`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:35
msgid "However, this playbook installs your Matrix server on another domain (e.g. `matrix.example.com`) and not on the base domain (e.g. `example.com`), so it takes a little extra manual effort to set up the file."

msgid "copy `/.well-known/matrix/server` and `/.well-known/matrix/client` from the Matrix server (e.g. `matrix.example.com`) to your base domain's server (`example.com`). You can find these files in the `/matrix/static-files/.well-known/matrix` directory on the Matrix server.

[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header should be set with a value of `*`. If you don't do this step, web-based Matrix clients (like Element Web) may fail to work. Setting up headers for the `/.well-known/matrix/server` file is not necessary, as this file is only consumed by non-browsers, which don't care about CORS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:94
msgid "This is relatively easy to do and possibly your only choice if you can only host static files from the base domain's server.

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:102
msgid "With this method, you **don't need** to add special HTTP headers for [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) reasons (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`), because your Matrix server (where requests ultimately go) will be configured by this playbook correctly."
