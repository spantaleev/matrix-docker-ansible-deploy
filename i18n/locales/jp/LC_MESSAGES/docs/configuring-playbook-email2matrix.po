msgid "**Note**: this component has been deprecated. We recommend not bothering with installing it. While not a 1:1 replacement, the author suggests taking a look at [Postmoogle](https://github.com/etkecc/postmoogle) as a replacement, which can also be installed using [this playbook](configuring-playbook-bridge-postmoogle.md). Consider using that component instead of this one."
