msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/howto-server-delegation.md:14
msgid "**Note**: as an alternative, it is possible to install the server such that it uses only the `matrix.example.com` domain (instead of identifying as the shorter base domain - `example.com`). This should be helpful if you are not in control of anything on the base domain (`example.com`). In this case, you would not need to configure server delegation, but you would need to add other configuration. For more information, see [How do I install on matrix.example.com without involving the base domain?](faq.md#how-do-i-install-on-matrix-example-com-without-involving-the-base-domain) on our FAQ."
