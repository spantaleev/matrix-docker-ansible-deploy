msgid "We're not sure what's the minimum version of Ansible that can run this playbook successfully. The lowest version that we've confirmed (on 2022-11-26) to be working fine is: `ansible-core` (`2.11.7`) combined with `ansible` (`4.10.0`)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:20
msgid "Depending on your distribution, you may be able to upgrade Ansible in a few different ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:22
msgid "by using an additional repository (PPA, etc.), which provides newer Ansible versions. See instructions for [CentOS](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-rhel-centos-or-fedora), [Debian](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-debian), or [Ubuntu](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu) on the Ansible website."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:24
msgid "by removing the Ansible package (`yum remove ansible` or `apt-get remove ansible`) and installing via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (`pip install ansible`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:26
msgid "If using the `pip` method, do note that the `ansible-playbook` binary may not be on the `$PATH` (https://linuxconfig.org/linux-path-environment-variable), but in some more special location like `/usr/local/bin/ansible-playbook`. You may need to invoke it using the full path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:28
msgid "**Note**: Both of the above methods are a bad way to run system software such as Ansible. If you find yourself needing to resort to such hacks, please consider reporting a bug to your distribution and/or switching to a sane distribution, which provides up-to-date software."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:40
msgid "To run Ansible in a (Docker) container on the Matrix server itself, you need to have a working Docker installation. Docker is normally installed by the playbook, so this may be a bit of a chicken and egg problem. To solve it:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:42
msgid "you **either** need to install Docker manually first. Follow [the upstream instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your distribution and consider setting `matrix_playbook_docker_installation_enabled: false` in your `vars.yml` file, to prevent the playbook from installing Docker"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:45
msgid "Once you have a working Docker installation on the server, **clone the playbook** somewhere on the server and configure it as per usual (`inventory/hosts`, `inventory/host_vars/…`, etc.), as described in [configuring the playbook](configuring-playbook.md)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:47
msgid "You would then need to add `ansible_connection=community.docker.nsenter` to the host line in `inventory/hosts`. This tells Ansible to connect to the \"remote\" machine by switching Linux namespaces with [nsenter](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html), instead of using SSH."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:49
