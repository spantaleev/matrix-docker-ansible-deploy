msgid "**Note**: the external server that you specify in `matrix_synapse_database_host` must be accessible from within the `matrix-synapse` Docker container (and possibly other containers too). This means that it either needs to be a publicly accessible hostname or that it's a hostname on the same Docker network where all containers installed by this playbook run (a network called `matrix` by default). Using a local PostgreSQL instance on the host (running on the same machine, but not in a container) is not possible."
