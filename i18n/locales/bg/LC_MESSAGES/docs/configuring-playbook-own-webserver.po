msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-playbook-own-webserver.md:138
msgid "If you wish to use another webserver, the integrated reverse-proxy webserver usually gets in the way because it attempts to fetch SSL certificates and binds to ports 80, 443 and 8448 (if Matrix Federation is enabled)."

msgid "Also, the Traefik reverse-proxy, besides fronting everything is also serving a 2nd purpose of allowing addons services to communicate with the Matrix homeserver thanks to its `matrix-internal-matrix-client-api` entrypoint (read more about it above). Disabling Traefik completely means the playbook would wire services to directly talk to the homeserver. This can work for basic setups, but not for more complex setups involving [matrix-media-repo](./configuring-playbook-matrix-media-repo.md), [matrix-corporal](./configuring-playbook-matrix-corporal.md) or other such services that need to \"steal routes\" from the homeserver."

You should run something like this: `usermod -a -G matrix nginx`. This allows your webserver user to access files owned by the `matrix` group, so that it can serve static files from `/matrix/static-files`."
