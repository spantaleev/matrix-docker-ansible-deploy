If \"push\\_key\" shows your server but \"Url\" shows an external server such as `up.schildi.chat` then push notifications will still work but are being routed through that external server before they reach your ntfy server. To rectify that, in SchildiChat (at least around version 1.4.20.sc55) you must enable the `Force custom push gateway` setting as described in the \"Usage\" section above."
