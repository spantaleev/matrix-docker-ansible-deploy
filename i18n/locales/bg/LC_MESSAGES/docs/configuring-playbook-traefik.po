msgid "[!WARNING] Enabling the dashboard on a hostname you use for something else (like `matrix_server_fqn_matrix` in the configuration above) may cause conflicts. Enabling the Traefik Dashboard makes Traefik capture all `/dashboard` and `/api` requests and forward them to itself. If any of the services hosted on the same hostname requires any of these 2 URL prefixes, you will experience problems. So far, we're not aware of any playbook services which occupy these endpoints and are likely to cause conflicts."

Some services are also already available via the compatible [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook), but take a look at the minor [interoperability adjustments](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/interoperability.md)."
