msgid "The playbook supports self-building of various components, which don't have a container image for your architecture (see the [container images we use](container-images.md)). For `amd64`, self-building is not required."

#: ../../../docs/self-building.md:7
msgid "For other architectures (e.g. `arm32`, `arm64`), ready-made container images are used when available. If there's no ready-made image for a specific component and said component supports self-building, an image will be built on the host. Building images like this takes more time and resources (some build tools need to get installed by the playbook to assist building)."
