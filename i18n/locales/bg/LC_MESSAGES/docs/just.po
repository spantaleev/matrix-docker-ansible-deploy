msgid "We have previously used [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for easily running some playbook commands (e.g. `make roles` which triggers [`ansible-galaxy`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-galaxy.html)). Our [`Makefile`](../Makefile) is still around, and you can still run these commands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/just.md:5
msgid "In addition, we have added support for running commands via [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) - a more modern command-runner alternative to `make`. It can be used to invoke `ansible-playbook` commands with less typing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/just.md:7
msgid "The `just` utility executes shortcut commands (called as \"recipes\"), which invoke `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-galaxy` or [`agru`](https://github.com/etkecc/agru) (depending on what is available in your system). The targets of the recipes are defined in [`justfile`](../justfile). Most of the just recipes have no corresponding `Makefile` targets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/just.md:9
msgid "For some recipes such as `just update`, our `justfile` recommends installing [`agru`](https://github.com/etkecc/agru) (a faster alternative to `ansible-galaxy`) to speed up the process."

If you find it difficult to install it, do not find it useful, or want to prefer raw `ansible-playbook` commands for some reason, feel free to run all commands manually. For example, you can run `ansible-galaxy` directly to install the Ansible roles: `rm -rf roles/galaxy; ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p roles/galaxy/ --force`."

The recipes are shortcuts of commands defined in `justfile` and can be executed by the `just` program only, while the playbook tags are available for the raw `ansible-playbook` commands as well. Please be careful not to confuse them."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/just.md:38
msgid "Such kind of difference sometimes matters. For example, when you install a Matrix server into which you will import old data (see [here](installing.md#installing-a-server-into-which-youll-import-old-data)), you are not supposed to run `just install-all` or `just setup-all`, because these commands start services immediately after installing components which may prevent your from importing old data."
