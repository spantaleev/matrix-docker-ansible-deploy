This playbook uses a Postgres database name of `synapse` by default (controlled by the `matrix_synapse_database_database` variable). If your database name differs, be sure to change `matrix_synapse_database_database` to your desired name and to re-run the playbook before proceeding."

You can easily do this via the playbook by running `just run-tags run-postgres-vacuum -e postgres_vacuum_preset=analyze` (see [Vacuuming PostgreSQL](maintenance-postgres.md#vacuuming-postgresql) for more details)."
