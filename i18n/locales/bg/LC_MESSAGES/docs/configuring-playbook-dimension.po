msgid "This playbook now supports running Dimension in both a federated and [unfederated](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/unfederated.md) environments. This is handled automatically based on the value of `matrix_homeserver_federation_enabled`. Enabling Dimension, means that the `openid` API endpoints will be exposed on the Matrix Federation port (usually `8448`), even if [federation](configuring-playbook-federation.md) is disabled. It's something to be aware of, especially in terms of firewall whitelisting (make sure port `8448` is accessible)."
