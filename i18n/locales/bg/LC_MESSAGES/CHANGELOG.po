msgid "(Backward Compatibility Break) Synapse now defaults to enabling authenticated media"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../CHANGELOG.md:5
msgid "**TLDR**: with this update, your Synapse homeserver will start requiring authentication for newly-uploaded media files. While the majority of the ecosystem (clients, bots, etc.) should support this, certain software may lack support for it (and you may wish to turn it off, if it's causing issues)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../CHANGELOG.md:24
msgid "**TLDR**: if the playbook installed KeyDB (or Redis) as a dependency for you before, it will now replace it with [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) (a drop-in alternative). We [previously switched from Redis to KeyDB](#backward-compatibility-break-the-playbook-now-defaults-to-keydb-instead-of-redis), but Valkey is a better alternative, so we're switching again."

This search engine tries to go through the Matrix federation and discover & index public rooms to allow people to find them.

Today (on 23rd of October 2023), `matrixrooms.info` is indexing `23066` Matrix servers. Of these, only `1567` servers (7%) are making their public rooms discoverable. Who knows what wonderful communities and rooms are available on these 93% other Matrix servers that are supposedly federating, but are still gate-keeping their public room list.

With the introduction of Matrix Spaces, you can reorganize your flow around spaces - you can auto-join your users to a Matrix Space (via Synapse's `auto_join_rooms` setting - controlled by our `matrix_synapse_auto_join_rooms` variable), then add a bunch of rooms to the space and make them joinable by people belonging to the space. That is to say, do not make rooms public and do not publish them to the room directory unless they are really public. Instead, use other mechanisms for semi-public rooms or private rooms. One alternative is to stick to what you're doing (public rooms published to your rooms directory) but having a `m.federate: true` flag set during creation (clients like Element Web have a nice UI checkbox for this) to explicitly disable federation for them."
