msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:22
msgid "(important) **Federation Server discovery** (`/.well-known/matrix/server`) — assists other servers in the Matrix network with finding your server. With the default playbook configuration specified on the sample `vars.yml` ([`examples/vars.yml`](../examples/vars.yml)), this is necessary for federation to work. Without a proper configuration, your server will effectively not be part of the Matrix network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:24
msgid "(less important) **Client Server discovery** (`/.well-known/matrix/client`) — assists programs that you use to connect to your server (e.g. Element Web), so that they can make it more convenient for you by automatically configuring the \"Homeserver URL\" and \"Identity Server URL\" addresses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:26
msgid "(optional) **Support service discovery** (`/.well-known/matrix/support`) — returns server admin contact and support page of the domain."

msgid "All services created by this playbook are meant to be installed on their own server (such as `matrix.example.com`), instead of the base domain (`example.com`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:32
msgid "As [per the Server-Server specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html#server-discovery), in order to use a short Matrix user ID like `@alice:example.com` instead of `@alice:matrix.example.com` while hosting services on a subdomain such as `matrix.example.com`, the Matrix network needs to be instructed of [server delegation](howto-server-delegation.md) / redirection."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:42
msgid "This lets you (and your users) easily connect to your Matrix server without having to customize connection URLs. When using client programs that support it, you won't need to point them to `https://matrix.example.com` in Custom Server options manually anymore. The connection URL would be discovered automatically from your full username."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:44
msgid "Without /.well-known/matrix/client, the client will make the wrong \"homeserver URL\" assumption (it will default to using https://example.com, and users will need to notice and adjust it manually (changing it to https://matrix.example.com)."

msgid "As [per the Client-Server specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#server-discovery) Matrix does Client Server service discovery using a `/.well-known/matrix/client` file hosted on the base domain (e.g. `example.com`)."

#: ../../../docs/configuring-well-known.md:48

If you don't do this step, web-based Matrix clients (like Element Web) may fail to work. Setting up headers for the `/.well-known/matrix/server` file is not necessary, as this file is only consumed by non-browsers, which don't care about CORS."
