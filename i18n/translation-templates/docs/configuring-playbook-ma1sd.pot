msgid "**⚠️Note**: ma1sd itself has also been unmaintained for years (the latest commit and release being from 2021). The role of identity servers in the Matrix specification also has an uncertain future. **We recommend not bothering with installing it unless it's the only way you can do what you need to do**. For example, certain things like LDAP integration can also be implemented via [the LDAP provider module for Synapse](./configuring-playbook-ldap-auth.md)."
