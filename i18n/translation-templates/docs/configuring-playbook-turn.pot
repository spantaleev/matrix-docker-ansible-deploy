msgid "By default, this playbook installs and configures the [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) as a TURN server, through which clients can make audio/video calls even from [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)-ed networks. It also configures the Synapse chat server by default, so that it points to the coturn TURN server installed by the playbook. If that's okay, you can skip this document."

#: ../../../docs/configuring-playbook-turn.md:32
msgid "If you'd like to rely on external IP address auto-detection (not recommended unless you need it), set an empty value to the variable. The playbook will automatically contact an [echoip](https://github.com/mpolden/echoip)-compatible service (`https://ifconfig.co/json` by default) to determine your server's IP address. This API endpoint is configurable via the `coturn_turn_external_ip_address_auto_detection_echoip_service_url` variable."

See [this page](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/services/echoip.md) for the instruction to install it with the playbook. If you are wondering how to use it for your Matrix server, refer to [this page](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/setting-up-services-on-mdad-server.md) for the overview."
