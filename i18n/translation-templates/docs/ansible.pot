msgid "We're not sure what's the minimum version of Ansible that can run this playbook successfully. The lowest version that we suspect (on 2025-09-03) to be working fine is: `ansible-core` (`2.15.1`)."

msgid "If your distro ships with an Ansible version older than this, you may run into issues. Consider [Upgrading Ansible](#upgrading-ansible) or [using Ansible via Docker](#using-ansible-via-docker)."

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:27
msgid "[!WARNING] One reason for the version requirement being as such is that the playbook by default installs Docker for you using [this Docker role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker) which [has a hard requirement on Ansible v2.15.1](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker/commit/7f44a1d9ad8132819ea9852918bca5dab8757cd0). If you install Docker yourself another way, you can tell the playbook to skip running this role (by adding `matrix_playbook_docker_installation_enabled: false` to your `vars.yml` configuration). It may then be possible to get the playbook running on an older version of Ansible. Still, this is a complication and your mileage may vary. We recommend [upgrading Ansible](#upgrading-ansible) instead of going into uncharted territory."

See instructions for [CentOS](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-rhel-centos-or-fedora), [Debian](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-debian), or [Ubuntu](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu) on the Ansible website."

msgid "If using the `pip` method, do note that the `ansible-playbook` binary may not be on the `$PATH` (https://linuxconfig.org/linux-path-environment-variable), but in some more special location like `/usr/local/bin/ansible-playbook`. You may need to invoke it using the full path."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/ansible.md:40
msgid "**Note**: Both of the above methods are a bad way to run system software such as Ansible. If you find yourself needing to resort to such hacks, please consider reporting a bug to your distribution and/or switching to a sane distribution, which provides up-to-date software."

msgid "you **either** need to install Docker manually first. Follow [the upstream instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your distribution and consider setting `matrix_playbook_docker_installation_enabled: false` in your `vars.yml` file, to prevent the playbook from installing Docker"
