You are also able to more easily customise your normal Draupnir than D4A as D4A even on the branch with the Avatar command (To be Upstreamed to Mainline Draupnir) that command is clunky as it requires the use of things like Element Web devtools. In normal Draupnir this is a quick operation where you login to Draupnir with a normal client and set Avatar and Display name normally."
