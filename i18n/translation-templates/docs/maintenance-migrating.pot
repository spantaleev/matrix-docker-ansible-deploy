msgid "This migration guide is applicable if you migrate from one server to another server having the same CPU architecture (e.g. both servers being `amd64`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/maintenance-migrating.md:8
msgid "If you're trying to migrate between different architectures (e.g. `amd64` --> `arm64`), simply copying the complete `/matrix` directory is **not** possible as it would move the raw PostgreSQL data (`/matrix/postgres/data`) between different architectures. In this specific case, you can use the guide below as a reference, but you would also need to avoid syncing `/matrix/postgres/data` to the new host, and also dump the database on your current server and import it properly on the new server. See our [Backing up PostgreSQL](maintenance-postgres.md#backing-up-postgresql) docs for help with PostgreSQL backup/restore."

msgid "If you have any questions about migration or encountered an issue during migration, do not hesitate to ask for help on [our Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/%23matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com). You probably might want to prepare a temporary/sub account on another Matrix server in case it becomes impossible to use your server due to migration failure by any chance."
