msgid "**Note**: in the sample `vars.yml` ([`examples/vars.yml`](../examples/vars.yml)), we recommend to use a short user ID like `@alice:example.com` instead of `@alice:matrix.example.com` and set up [server delegation](howto-server-delegation.md) / redirection. Without a proper configuration, your server will effectively not be part of the Matrix network. If you find your server is not federated, make sure to [check whether services work](maintenance-checking-services.md) and your server is properly delegated."

Services like [Dimension](configuring-playbook-dimension.md) and [ma1sd](configuring-playbook-ma1sd.md) normally rely on `openid` APIs exposed on that port. Even if you disable federation and only if necessary, we may still be exposing the federation port and serving the `openid` APIs there.
