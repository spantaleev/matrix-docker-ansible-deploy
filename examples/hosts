# We explicitly ask for your server's external IP address, because the same value is used for configuring Coturn.
# If you'd rather use a local IP here, make sure to set up `matrix_coturn_turn_external_ip_address`.
#
# To connect using a non-root user (and elevate to root with sudo later),
# replace `ansible_ssh_user=root` with something like this: `ansible_ssh_user=username become=true become_user=root`.
# If sudo requires a password, either add `become_password=PASSWORD_HERE` to the host line
# or tell Ansible to ask you for the password interactively by adding a `--ask-become-pass` (`-K`) flag to all `ansible-playbook` (or `just`) commands.
#
# For improved Ansible performance, SSH pipelining is enabled by default in `ansible.cfg`.
# If this causes SSH connection troubles, disable it by adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining=False`
# to the host line below or by adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining: False` to your variables file.
#
# If you're running this Ansible playbook on the same server as the one you're installing to,
# consider adding an additional `ansible_connection=local` argument to the host line below.
#
# Ansible may fail to discover which Python interpreter to use on the host for some distros (like Ubuntu 20.04).
# You may sometimes need to explicitly add the argument `ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3`
# to the host line below.
