# A Synapse generic worker can handle both federation and client-server API endpoints.
# We wish to split these, as we normally serve federation separately and don't want them mixed up.
#
# This is some ugly Ansible/Jinja2 hack (seen here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47831492),
# which takes a list of various strings and removes the ones NOT containing `/_matrix/client` anywhere in them.
#
# We intentionally don't do a diff between everything possible (`matrix_synapse_workers_generic_worker_endpoints`) and `matrix_synapse_workers_generic_worker_federation_endpoints`,
# because `matrix_synapse_workers_generic_worker_endpoints` also contains things like `/_synapse/client/`, etc.
# While /_synapse/client/ endpoints are somewhat client-server API-related, they're:
# - neither part of the client-server API spec (and are thus, different)
# - nor always OK to forward to a worker (we're supposed to obey `matrix_nginx_proxy_proxy_matrix_client_api_forwarded_location_synapse_client_api_enabled`)
#
# It's also not too many of these APIs (only `^/_synapse/client/password_reset/email/submit_token$` at the time of this writing / 2021-01-24),
# so it's not that important whether we forward them or not.
#
# Basically, we aim to cover most things. Skipping `/_synapse/client` or a few other minor things doesn't matter too much.
