  # Additionally, the following REST endpoints can be handled for GET requests:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/federation/v1/groups/

  # Pagination requests can also be handled, but all requests for a given
  # room must be routed to the same instance. Additionally, care must be taken to
  # ensure that the purge history admin API is not used while pagination requests
  # for the room are in flight:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|unstable)/rooms/.*/messages$

  # Additionally, the following endpoints should be included if Synapse is configured
  # to use SSO (you only need to include the ones for whichever SSO provider you're
  # using):

  # for all SSO providers
  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|unstable)/login/sso/redirect

  # CAS requests.

  # Ensure that all SSO logins go to a single process.
  # For multiple workers not handling the SSO endpoints properly, see
  # [#7530](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7530) and
  # [#9427](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9427).

  # Note that a HTTP listener with `client` and `federation` resources must be
  # configured in the `worker_listeners` option in the worker config.

  # #### Load balancing

  # It is possible to run multiple instances of this worker app, with incoming requests
  # being load-balanced between them by the reverse-proxy. However, different endpoints
  # have different characteristics and so admins
  # may wish to run multiple groups of workers handling different endpoints so that
  # load balancing can be done in different ways.

  # For `/sync` and `/initialSync` requests it will be more efficient if all
  # requests from a particular user are routed to a single instance. Extracting a
  # user ID from the access token or `Authorization` header is currently left as an
  # exercise for the reader. Admins may additionally wish to separate out `/sync`
  # requests that have a `since` query parameter from those that don't (and
  # `/initialSync`), as requests that don't are known as "initial sync" that happens
  # when a user logs in on a new device and can be *very* resource intensive, so
  # isolating these requests will stop them from interfering with other users ongoing
  # syncs.

  # Federation and client requests can be balanced via simple round robin.

  # The inbound federation transaction request `^/_matrix/federation/v1/send/`
  # should be balanced by source IP so that transactions from the same remote server
  # go to the same process.

  # Registration/login requests can be handled separately purely to help ensure that
  # unexpected load doesn't affect new logins and sign ups.

  # Finally, event sending requests can be balanced by the room ID in the URI (or
  # the full URI, or even just round robin), the room ID is the path component after
  # `/rooms/`. If there is a large bridge connected that is sending or may send lots
  # of events, then a dedicated set of workers can be provisioned to limit the
  # effects of bursts of events from that bridge on events sent by normal users.

  # #### Stream writers

  # Additionally, there is *experimental* support for moving writing of specific
  # streams (such as events) off of the main process to a particular worker. (This
  # is only supported with Redis-based replication.)

  # Currently supported streams are `events` and `typing`.

  # To enable this, the worker must have a HTTP replication listener configured,
  # have a `worker_name` and be listed in the `instance_map` config. For example to
  # move event persistence off to a dedicated worker, the shared configuration would
  # include:

  # ```yaml
  # instance_map:
  #     event_persister1:
  #         host: localhost
  #         port: 8034

  # stream_writers:
  #     events: event_persister1
  # ```

  # The `events` stream also experimentally supports having multiple writers, where
  # work is sharded between them by room ID. Note that you *must* restart all worker
  # instances when adding or removing event persisters. An example `stream_writers`
  # configuration with multiple writers:

  # ```yaml
  # stream_writers:
  #     events:
  #         - event_persister1
  #         - event_persister2
  # ```

  # #### Background tasks

  # There is also *experimental* support for moving background tasks to a separate
  # worker. Background tasks are run periodically or started via replication. Exactly
  # which tasks are configured to run depends on your Synapse configuration (e.g. if
  # stats is enabled).

  # To enable this, the worker must have a `worker_name` and can be configured to run
  # background tasks. For example, to move background tasks to a dedicated worker,
  # the shared configuration would include:

  # ```yaml
  # run_background_tasks_on: background_worker
  # ```

  # You might also wish to investigate the `update_user_directory` and
  # `media_instance_running_background_jobs` settings.

# pusher worker (no API endpoints) [
  # Handles sending push notifications to sygnal and email. Doesn't handle any
  # REST endpoints itself, but you should set `start_pushers: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse sending push notifications.

  # To run multiple instances at once the `pusher_instances` option should list all
  # pusher instances by their worker name, e.g.:

  # ```yaml
  # pusher_instances:
  #     - pusher_worker1
  #     - pusher_worker2
  # ```

# ]

# appservice worker (no API endpoints) [
  # Handles sending output traffic to Application Services. Doesn't handle any
  # REST endpoints itself, but you should set `notify_appservices: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse sending appservice notifications.

  # Note this worker cannot be load-balanced: only one instance should be active.

# ]

# federation_sender worker (no API endpoints) [
  # Handles sending federation traffic to other servers. Doesn't handle any
  # REST endpoints itself, but you should set `send_federation: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse sending this traffic.

  # If running multiple federation senders then you must list each
  # instance in the `federation_sender_instances` option by their `worker_name`.
  # All instances must be stopped and started when adding or removing instances.
  # For example:

  # ```yaml
  # federation_sender_instances:
  #     - federation_sender1
  #     - federation_sender2
  # ```
# ]

matrix_synapse_workers_media_repository_endpoints:
  # Handles the media repository. It can handle all endpoints starting with:

  - ^/_matrix/media/

  # ... and the following regular expressions matching media-specific administration APIs:

  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/purge_media_cache$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/room/.*/media.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/user/.*/media.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/media/.*$
  - ^/_synapse/admin/v1/quarantine_media/.*$

  # You should also set `enable_media_repo: False` in the shared configuration
  # file to stop the main synapse running background jobs related to managing the
  # media repository.

  # In the `media_repository` worker configuration file, configure the http listener to
  # expose the `media` resource. For example:

  # ```yaml
  #     worker_listeners:
  #      - type: http
  #        port: 8085
  #        resources:
  #          - names:
  #            - media
  # ```

  # Note that if running multiple media repositories they must be on the same server
  # and you must configure a single instance to run the background tasks, e.g.:

  # ```yaml
  #     media_instance_running_background_jobs: "media-repository-1"
  # ```

  # Note that if a reverse proxy is used , then `/_matrix/media/` must be routed for both inbound client and federation requests (if they are handled separately).

matrix_synapse_workers_user_dir_endpoints:
  # Handles searches in the user directory. It can handle REST endpoints matching
  # the following regular expressions:

  - ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|unstable)/user_directory/search$

  # When using this worker you must also set `update_user_directory: False` in the
  # shared configuration file to stop the main synapse running background
  # jobs related to updating the user directory.

matrix_synapse_workers_frontend_proxy_endpoints:
  # Proxies some frequently-requested client endpoints to add caching and remove
  # load from the main synapse. It can handle REST endpoints matching the following
  # regular expressions:

  - ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|unstable)/keys/upload

  # If `use_presence` is False in the homeserver config, it can also handle REST
  # endpoints matching the following regular expressions:

  # FIXME: ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED: to be enabled manually
  # ^/_matrix/client/(api/v1|r0|unstable)/presence/[^/]+/status

  # This "stub" presence handler will pass through `GET` request but make the
  # `PUT` effectively a no-op.

  # It will proxy any requests it cannot handle to the main synapse instance. It
  # must therefore be configured with the location of the main instance, via
  # the `worker_main_http_uri` setting in the `frontend_proxy` worker configuration
  # file. For example:

  #     worker_main_http_uri: http://127.0.0.1:8008
