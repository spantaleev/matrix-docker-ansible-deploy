#  wordlist:
#    # A list of words which should be monitored by the bot.  These will match if any part

# Options for monitoring the health of the bot
health:
  # healthz options. These options are best for use in container environments
  # like Kubernetes to detect how healthy the service is. The bot will report
  # that it is unhealthy until it is able to process user requests. Typically
  # this means that it'll flag itself as unhealthy for a number of minutes
  # before saying "Now monitoring rooms" and flagging itself healthy.
  #
  # Health is flagged through HTTP status codes, defined below.
  healthz:
    # Whether the healthz integration should be enabled (default false)
    enabled: false

    # The port to expose the webserver on. Defaults to 8080.
    port: 8080

    # The address to listen for requests on. Defaults to all addresses.
    address: "0.0.0.0"

    # The path to expose the monitoring endpoint at. Defaults to `/healthz`
    endpoint: "/healthz"

    # The HTTP status code which reports that the bot is healthy/ready to
    # process requests. Typically this should not be changed. Defaults to
    # 200.
    healthyStatus: 200

    # The HTTP status code which reports that the bot is not healthy/ready.
