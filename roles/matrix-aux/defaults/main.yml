# matrix-aux is a role that manages auxiliary files and directories on your Matrix server.
#
# Certain components (like matrix-synapse, etc.) may sometimes require additional templates (email templates, privacy policies, etc.).
# This role allows such files to be managed by the playbook.
#
# Note that files and directories created via this role are not automatically made available for containers to use.
# If you use this role to put files in a directory that's already mounted into a container,
# you can access the files without additional work.
# Otherwise, you'd need to mount the file/directory to the container that needs it.
# Roles usually provide a `matrix_*_additional_volumes` or `matrix_*_container_extra_arguments` variable
# that you can use to mount an additional volume.

# The default permission mode when creating directories using `matrix_aux_directory_definitions`
matrix_aux_directory_default_mode: '0750'

# Holds a list of directories to create on the server.
#
# By default, directories are:
# - created with permissions as specified in `matrix_aux_directory_default_mode`
# - owned by the `matrix_user_username` user and `matrix_user_groupname` group (usually `matrix:matrix`)
#
# Example:
#
# matrix_aux_directory_definitions:
#   - dest: /matrix/aux
#
#   - dest: /matrix/another
#     mode: '0700'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'

# The default permission mode when creating directories using `matrix_aux_directory_definitions`
matrix_aux_file_default_mode: '0640'

# Holds a list of files to create on the server.
#
# By default, files are:
# - created with permissions as specified in `matrix_aux_file_default_mode`
# - owned by the `matrix_user_username` user and `matrix_user_groupname` group (usually `matrix:matrix`)
#
# You can define the file content inline (in your `vars.yml` file) or as an external file (see the example below).
# Defining the content inline in `vars.yml` has the benefit of not splitting your configuration into multiple files,
# but rather keeping everything inside `vars.yml` (which also gets backed up on the server in `/matrix/vars.yml`).
#
# Note: parent paths for files must exist.
# If you've defined a file with a destination of `/matrix/some/path/file.txt`,
# then you likely need to add `/matrix/some/path` to `matrix_aux_directory_definitions` as well.
# You don't need to do this for directories that the playbook already creates for you.
#
# Example:
#
# matrix_aux_file_definitions:
#   - dest: "{{ matrix_synapse_config_dir_path }}/something.html"
#     content: |
#       <!doctype html>
#       <html><body>Something</body></html>
#
#   - dest: /matrix/aux/some-other-file.txt
#     content: "Something"
#     mode: '0600'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'
#
#   - dest: /matrix/aux/yet-another-file.txt
#     content: "{{ lookup('template', '/path/to/file.txt.j2') }}"
#     mode: '0600'
#     owner: 'some-user'
#     group: 'some-group'
