## Server ##

# The public-facing domain of the server
#
# The server_name name will appear at the end of usernames and room addresses
# created on this server. For example if the server_name was example.com,
# usernames on this server would be in the format @user:example.com
#
# In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
# matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the server_name for the same
# reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email address.
# See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/delegate.md
# for information on how to host Synapse on a subdomain while preserving
# a clean server_name.
#
# The server_name cannot be changed later so it is important to
# configure this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all
# lowercase and may contain an explicit port.
# Examples: matrix.org, localhost:8080
#
server_name: "{{ matrix_domain }}"

#
# This option can be also set to the filesystem path to the web client
# which will be served at /_matrix/client/ if 'webclient' is configured
# under the 'listeners' configuration, however this is a security risk:

  # Retention policy limits. If set, and the state of a room contains a
  # 'm.room.retention' event in its state which contains a 'min_lifetime' or a
  # 'max_lifetime' that's out of these bounds, Synapse will cap the room's policy
  # to these limits when running purge jobs.
  #
  #allowed_lifetime_min: 1d
  #allowed_lifetime_max: 1y

  # Server admins can define the settings of the background jobs purging the
  # events which lifetime has expired under the 'purge_jobs' section.
  #
  # If no configuration is provided, a single job will be set up to delete expired
  # events in every room daily.
  #
  # Each job's configuration defines which range of message lifetimes the job
  # takes care of. For example, if 'shortest_max_lifetime' is '2d' and
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' is '3d', the job will handle purging expired events in
  # rooms whose state defines a 'max_lifetime' that's both higher than 2 days, and
  # lower than or equal to 3 days. Both the minimum and the maximum value of a
  # range are optional, e.g. a job with no 'shortest_max_lifetime' and a
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' of '3d' will handle every room with a retention policy
  # which 'max_lifetime' is lower than or equal to three days.
  #
  # The rationale for this per-job configuration is that some rooms might have a
  # retention policy with a low 'max_lifetime', where history needs to be purged
  # of outdated messages on a more frequent basis than for the rest of the rooms
  # (e.g. every 12h), but not want that purge to be performed by a job that's
  # iterating over every room it knows, which could be heavy on the server.
  #
  # If any purge job is configured, it is strongly recommended to have at least
  # a single job with neither 'shortest_max_lifetime' nor 'longest_max_lifetime'
  # set, or one job without 'shortest_max_lifetime' and one job without
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' set. Otherwise some rooms might be ignored, even if
  # 'allowed_lifetime_min' and 'allowed_lifetime_max' are set, because capping a
  # room's policy to these values is done after the policies are retrieved from
  # Synapse's database (which is done using the range specified in a purge job's
  # configuration).
  #

  #  - longest_max_lifetime: 3d

# ACME support: This will configure Synapse to request a valid TLS certificate
# for your configured `server_name` via Let's Encrypt.
#
# Note that ACME v1 is now deprecated, and Synapse currently doesn't support
# ACME v2. This means that this feature currently won't work with installs set
# up after November 2019. For more info, and alternative solutions, see
# https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/ACME.md#deprecation-of-acme-v1
#
# Note that provisioning a certificate in this way requires port 80 to be
# routed to Synapse so that it can complete the http-01 ACME challenge.
# By default, if you enable ACME support, Synapse will attempt to listen on
# port 80 for incoming http-01 challenges - however, this will likely fail
# with 'Permission denied' or a similar error.
#
# There are a couple of potential solutions to this:
#
#  * If you already have an Apache, Nginx, or similar listening on port 80,
#    you can configure Synapse to use an alternate port, and have your web
#    server forward the requests. For example, assuming you set 'port: 8009'
#    below, on Apache, you would write:
#
#    ProxyPass /.well-known/acme-challenge http://localhost:8009/.well-known/acme-challenge
#
#  * Alternatively, you can use something like `authbind` to give Synapse
#    permission to listen on port 80.

# List of allowed TLS fingerprints for this server to publish along

# make HTTPS requests to this server will check that the TLS
# certificates returned by this server match one of the fingerprints.
#
# Synapse automatically adds the fingerprint of its own certificate
# to the list. So if federation traffic is handled directly by synapse
# then no modification to the list is required.
#
# If synapse is run behind a load balancer that handles the TLS then it
# will be necessary to add the fingerprints of the certificates used by
# the loadbalancers to this list if they are different to the one
# synapse is using.
#
# Homeservers are permitted to cache the list of TLS fingerprints
# returned in the key responses up to the "valid_until_ts" returned in
# key. It may be necessary to publish the fingerprints of a new
# certificate and wait until the "valid_until_ts" of the previous key
# responses have passed before deploying it.
#
# You can calculate a fingerprint from a given TLS listener via:
# openssl s_client -connect $host:$port < /dev/null 2> /dev/null |
#   openssl x509 -outform DER | openssl sha256 -binary | base64 | tr -d '='
# or by checking matrix.org/federationtester/api/report?server_name=$host

## Federation ##

# Restrict federation to the following whitelist of domains.

## Ratelimiting ##

# Ratelimiting settings for client actions (registration, login, messaging).
#
# Each ratelimiting configuration is made of two parameters:
#   - per_second: number of requests a client can send per second.
#   - burst_count: number of requests a client can send before being throttled.
#
# Synapse currently uses the following configurations:
#   - one for messages that ratelimits sending based on the account the client
#     is using
#   - one for registration that ratelimits registration requests based on the
#     client's IP address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the client's IP
#     address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into, based on the amount of failed login
#     attempts for this account.
#   - one for ratelimiting redactions by room admins. If this is not explicitly
#     set then it uses the same ratelimiting as per rc_message. This is useful
#     to allow room admins to deal with abuse quickly.
#   - two for ratelimiting number of rooms a user can join, "local" for when
#     users are joining rooms the server is already in (this is cheap) vs
#     "remote" for when users are trying to join rooms not on the server (which
#     can be more expensive)
#
# The defaults are as shown below.
#
#rc_message:
#  per_second: 0.2
#  burst_count: 10
rc_message: {{ matrix_synapse_rc_message|to_json }}

#   - sleep_delay: duration in milliseconds to delay processing events
#     from remote servers by if they go over the sleep limit.
#   - reject_limit: maximum number of concurrent federation requests
#     allowed from a single server
#   - concurrent: number of federation requests to concurrently process
#     from a single server
#
# The defaults are as shown below.
#
#rc_federation:
#  window_size: 1000
#  sleep_limit: 10
#  sleep_delay: 500

#
# Each list entry is a dictionary of url component attributes as returned
# by urlparse.urlsplit as applied to the absolute form of the URL.  See

old_signing_keys:
  # For each key, `key` should be the base64-encoded public key, and
  # `expired_ts`should be the time (in milliseconds since the unix epoch) that
  # it was last used.
  #
  # It is possible to build an entry from an old signing.key file using the
  # `export_signing_key` script which is provided with synapse.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #"ed25519:id": { key: "base64string", expired_ts: 123456789123 }

# How long key response published by this server is valid for.
# Used to set the valid_until_ts in /key/v2 APIs.
# Determines how quickly servers will query to check which keys
# are still valid.
#
#key_refresh_interval: 1d

# The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
#
# When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
#
# Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
# Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
# will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
#
# This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
# is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
# Options for each entry in the list include:
#
#    server_name: the name of the server. required.
#
#    verify_keys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
#       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
#       one of the given keys.
#
#    accept_keys_insecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
#       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
#       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
#       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
#       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
#       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
#       behaviour.
#
# An example configuration might look like:
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: "my_trusted_server.example.com"
#    verify_keys:
#      "ed25519:auto": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmopqr"
#  - server_name: "my_other_trusted_server.example.com"
#

## Single sign-on integration ##

# The following settings can be used to make Synapse use a single sign-on
# provider for authentication, instead of its internal password database.
#
# You will probably also want to set the following options to `false` to
# disable the regular login/registration flows:
#   * enable_registration
#   * password_config.enabled
#
# You will also want to investigate the settings under the "sso" configuration
# section below.

# Enable SAML2 for registration and login. Uses pysaml2.
#
# At least one of `sp_config` or `config_path` must be set in this section to
# enable SAML login.
#
# Once SAML support is enabled, a metadata file will be exposed at
# https://<server>:<port>/_matrix/saml2/metadata.xml, which you may be able to
# use to configure your SAML IdP with. Alternatively, you can manually configure
# the IdP to use an ACS location of
# https://<server>:<port>/_matrix/saml2/authn_response.
#
saml2_config:
  # `sp_config` is the configuration for the pysaml2 Service Provider.
  # See pysaml2 docs for format of config.
  #
  # Default values will be used for the 'entityid' and 'service' settings,
  # so it is not normally necessary to specify them unless you need to
  # override them.
  #
  sp_config:
    # Point this to the IdP's metadata. You must provide either a local
    # file via the `local` attribute or (preferably) a URL via the
    # `remote` attribute.
    #
    #metadata:
    #  local: ["saml2/idp.xml"]
    #  remote:
    #    - url: https://our_idp/metadata.xml

    # Allowed clock difference in seconds between the homeserver and IdP.
    #
    # Uncomment the below to increase the accepted time difference from 0 to 3 seconds.
    #
    #accepted_time_diff: 3

    # By default, the user has to go to our login page first. If you'd like
    # to allow IdP-initiated login, set 'allow_unsolicited: true' in a
    # 'service.sp' section:
    #
    #service:
    #  sp:
    #    allow_unsolicited: true

    # The examples below are just used to generate our metadata xml, and you
    # may well not need them, depending on your setup. Alternatively you
    # may need a whole lot more detail - see the pysaml2 docs!

# 'template_dir' gives the location of the templates for the HTML forms.
# This directory should contain one subdirectory per language (eg, 'en', 'fr'),
# and each language directory should contain the policy document (named as
# '<version>.html') and a success page (success.html).
#
# 'version' specifies the 'current' version of the policy document. It defines
# the version to be served by the consent resource if there is no 'v'
# parameter.
#
# 'server_notice_content', if enabled, will send a user a "Server Notice"
# asking them to consent to the privacy policy. The 'server_notices' section
# must also be configured for this to work. Notices will *not* be sent to
# guest users unless 'send_server_notice_to_guests' is set to true.
#
# 'block_events_error', if set, will block any attempts to send events
# until the user consents to the privacy policy. The value of the setting is
# used as the text of the error.
#
# 'require_at_registration', if enabled, will add a step to the registration
# process, similar to how captcha works. Users will be required to accept the
# policy before their account is created.
