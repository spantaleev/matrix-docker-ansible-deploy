- name: Fail if required Jitsi settings not defined
  fail:
    msg: >-
      You need to define a required configuration setting (`{{ item }}`) for using Jitsi.

      If you're setting up Jitsi for the first time, you may have missed a step.
      Refer to our setup instructions (docs/configuring-playbook-jitsi.md).

      If you had setup Jitsi successfully before and it's just now that you're observing this failure,
      it means that your installation may be using some default passwords that the playbook used to define until now.
      This is not secure and we urge you to rebuild your Jitsi setup.
      Refer to the "Rebuilding your Jitsi installation" section in our setup instructions (docs/configuring-playbook-jitsi.md).
