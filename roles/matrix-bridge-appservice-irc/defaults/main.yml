#
# matrix_appservice_irc_ircService_servers:
#   # The address of the server to connect to.
#   irc.example.com:
#     # A human-readable short name. This is used to label IRC status rooms
#     # where matrix users control their connections.
#     # E.g. 'ExampleNet IRC Bridge status'.
#     # It is also used in the Third Party Lookup API as the instance `desc`
#     # property, where each server is an instance.
#     name: "ExampleNet"

#     additionalAddresses: [ "irc2.example.com" ]
#     #
#     # [DEPRECATED] Use `name`, above, instead.
#     # A human-readable description string
#     # description: "Example.com IRC network"

#     # An ID for uniquely identifying this server amongst other servers being bridged.
#     # networkId: "example"

#     # URL to an icon used as the network icon whenever this network appear in
#     # a network list. (Like in the riot room directory, for instance.)
#     # icon: https://example.com/images/hash.png

#     # The port to connect to. Optional.

#     # Should the connection attempt to identify via SASL (if a server or user password is given)
#     # If false, this will use PASS instead. If SASL fails, we do not fallback to PASS.
#     sasl: false
#     # Whether to allow expired certs when connecting to the IRC server.

#     #  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

#     quitDebounce:
#       # Whether parts due to net-splits are debounced for delayMs, to allow

#       # a QUIT rate higher than quitsPerSecond. Default: false.
#       enabled: false

#       quitsPerSecond: 5
#       # The time window in which to wait before bridging a QUIT to Matrix that occurred during
#       # a netsplit. Debouncing is jittered randomly between delayMinMs and delayMaxMs so that the HS
#       # is not sent many requests to leave rooms all at once if a netsplit occurs and many
#       # people to not rejoin.
#       # If the user with the same IRC nick as the one who sent the quit rejoins a channel
#       # they are considered back online and the quit is not bridged, so long as the rejoin

#     # A map for conversion of IRC user modes to Matrix power levels. This enables bridging

#     botConfig:
#       # Enable the presence of the bot in IRC channels. The bot serves as the entity
#       # which maps from IRC -> Matrix. You can disable the bot entirely which
#       # means IRC -> Matrix chat will be shared by active "M-Nick" connections
#       # in the room. If there are no users in the room (or if there are users
#       # but their connections are not on IRC) then nothing will be bridged to
#       # Matrix. If you're concerned about the bot being treated as a "logger"
#       # entity, then you may want to disable the bot. If you want IRC->Matrix
#       # but don't want to have TCP connections to IRC unless a Matrix user speaks
#       # (because your client connection limit is low), then you may want to keep
#       # the bot enabled. Default: true.
#       # NB: If the bot is disabled, you SHOULD have matrix-to-IRC syncing turned
#       #     on, else there will be no users and no bot in a channel (meaning no
#       #     messages to Matrix!) until a Matrix user speaks which makes a client
#       #     join the target IRC channel.
#       # NBB: The bridge bot IRC client will still join the target IRC network so
#       #      it can service bridge-specific queries from the IRC-side e.g. so
#       #      real IRC clients have a way to change their Matrix display name.
