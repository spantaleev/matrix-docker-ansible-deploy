# Specifies how long to wait between starting systemd services and checking if they're started.
#
# A too low value may lead to a failure, as services may not have enough time to start and potentially fail.
#
# A value higher than 30 seconds (or any multiple of that) may also not work well, because a failing systemd service
# auto-restarts after 30 seconds (`RestartSec=30` in systemd service files).
# Checking if a service is running right after it had potentially restarted in such a way will lead us to
# thinking it's running, while it's merely starting again (and likely to fail again, given that it already did once).
#
# All of the services we manage are also started sequentially, which in itself can take a long time.
# There may be a ~10 second (or even larger) interval between starting the first service and starting the last one.
# This makes it even harder to pick a correct value. Such a 10 second gap and a waiting time of 20 seconds will
# put us right at the "dangerous" 30-second mark.
#
# We can try to measure this gap and adjust our waiting time accordingly, but we currently don't.
