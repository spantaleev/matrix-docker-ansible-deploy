## Modules ##

# Server admins can expand Synapse's functionality with external modules.
#
# See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html for more
# documentation on how to configure or create custom modules for Synapse.
#

## Server ##

# The public-facing domain of the server
#
# The server_name name will appear at the end of usernames and room addresses
# created on this server. For example if the server_name was example.com,
# usernames on this server would be in the format @user:example.com
#
# In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
# matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the server_name for the same
# reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email address.
# See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html
# for information on how to host Synapse on a subdomain while preserving
# a clean server_name.
#
# The server_name cannot be changed later so it is important to
# configure this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all
# lowercase and may contain an explicit port.
# Examples: matrix.org, localhost:8080
#
server_name: "{{ matrix_domain }}"

# The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this Homeserver (not
# including _matrix/...). This is the same URL a user might enter into the
# 'Custom Homeserver URL' field on their client. If you use Synapse with a
# reverse proxy, this should be the URL to reach Synapse via the proxy.
# Otherwise, it should be the URL to reach Synapse's client HTTP listener (see
# 'listeners' below).

# Message retention policy at the server level.
#
# Room admins and mods can define a retention period for their rooms using the

# the 'allowed_lifetime_min' and 'allowed_lifetime_max' config options.
#
# If this feature is enabled, Synapse will regularly look for and purge events
# which are older than the room's maximum retention period. Synapse will also
# filter events received over federation so that events that should have been
# purged are ignored and not stored again.
#
retention:
  # The message retention policies feature is disabled by default. Uncomment the
  # following line to enable it.
  #
  #enabled: true

  # Default retention policy. If set, Synapse will apply it to rooms that lack the
  # 'm.room.retention' state event. Currently, the value of 'min_lifetime' doesn't
  # matter much because Synapse doesn't take it into account yet.
  #
  #default_policy:
  #  min_lifetime: 1d
  #  max_lifetime: 1y

  # Retention policy limits. If set, and the state of a room contains a
  # 'm.room.retention' event in its state which contains a 'min_lifetime' or a
  # 'max_lifetime' that's out of these bounds, Synapse will cap the room's policy
  # to these limits when running purge jobs.
  #
  #allowed_lifetime_min: 1d
  #allowed_lifetime_max: 1y

  # Server admins can define the settings of the background jobs purging the
  # events which lifetime has expired under the 'purge_jobs' section.
  #
  # If no configuration is provided, a single job will be set up to delete expired
  # events in every room daily.
  #
  # Each job's configuration defines which range of message lifetimes the job
  # takes care of. For example, if 'shortest_max_lifetime' is '2d' and
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' is '3d', the job will handle purging expired events in
  # rooms whose state defines a 'max_lifetime' that's both higher than 2 days, and
  # lower than or equal to 3 days. Both the minimum and the maximum value of a
  # range are optional, e.g. a job with no 'shortest_max_lifetime' and a
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' of '3d' will handle every room with a retention policy
  # which 'max_lifetime' is lower than or equal to three days.
  #
  # The rationale for this per-job configuration is that some rooms might have a
  # retention policy with a low 'max_lifetime', where history needs to be purged
  # of outdated messages on a more frequent basis than for the rest of the rooms
  # (e.g. every 12h), but not want that purge to be performed by a job that's
  # iterating over every room it knows, which could be heavy on the server.
  #
  # If any purge job is configured, it is strongly recommended to have at least
  # a single job with neither 'shortest_max_lifetime' nor 'longest_max_lifetime'
  # set, or one job without 'shortest_max_lifetime' and one job without
  # 'longest_max_lifetime' set. Otherwise some rooms might be ignored, even if
  # 'allowed_lifetime_min' and 'allowed_lifetime_max' are set, because capping a
  # room's policy to these values is done after the policies are retrieved from
  # Synapse's database (which is done using the range specified in a purge job's
  # configuration).
  #
  #purge_jobs:
  #  - longest_max_lifetime: 3d
  #    interval: 12h
  #  - shortest_max_lifetime: 3d
  #    interval: 1d

## Federation ##

# Restrict federation to the following whitelist of domains.
# N.B. we recommend also firewalling your federation listener to limit
# inbound federation traffic as early as possible, rather than relying
# purely on this application-layer restriction.  If not specified, the
# default is to whitelist everything.

# Report prometheus metrics on the age of PDUs being sent to and received from

#
# By default, no domains are monitored in this way.
#
#federation_metrics_domains:

## Caching ##

# Caching can be configured through the following options.
#
# A cache 'factor' is a multiplier that can be applied to each of
# Synapse's caches in order to increase or decrease the maximum
# number of entries that can be stored.

# The number of events to cache in memory. Not affected by
# caches.global_factor.
#
event_cache_size: "{{ matrix_synapse_event_cache_size }}"

caches:
   # Controls the global cache factor, which is the default cache factor
   # for all caches if a specific factor for that cache is not otherwise
   # set.
   #
   # This can also be set by the "SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR" environment
   # variable. Setting by environment variable takes priority over
   # setting through the config file.
   #
   # Defaults to 0.5, which will half the size of all caches.
   #
   global_factor: {{ matrix_synapse_caches_global_factor }}

   # A dictionary of cache name to cache factor for that individual
   # cache. Overrides the global cache factor for a given cache.
   #
   # These can also be set through environment variables comprised
   # of "SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_" + the name of the cache in capital
   # letters and underscores. Setting by environment variable
   # takes priority over setting through the config file.
   # Ex. SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_GET_USERS_WHO_SHARE_ROOM_WITH_USER=2.0
   #
   # Some caches have '*' and other characters that are not
   # alphanumeric or underscores. These caches can be named with or
   # without the special characters stripped. For example, to specify
   # the cache factor for `*stateGroupCache*` via an environment
   # variable would be `SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR_STATEGROUPCACHE=2.0`.
   #
   per_cache_factors:
     #get_users_who_share_room_with_user: 2.0

  # Controls whether cache entries are evicted after a specified time
  # period. Defaults to true. Uncomment to disable this feature.
  #
  #expire_caches: false

  # If expire_caches is enabled, this flag controls how long an entry can
  # be in a cache without having been accessed before being evicted.
  # Defaults to 30m. Uncomment to set a different time to live for cache entries.
  #
  #cache_entry_ttl: 30m

  # Controls how long the results of a /sync request are cached for after
  # a successful response is returned. A higher duration can help clients with
  # intermittent connections, at the cost of higher memory usage.
  #
  # By default, this is zero, which means that sync responses are not cached
  # at all.
  #
  #sync_response_cache_duration: 2m


## Database ##

# The 'database' setting defines the database that synapse uses to store all of
# its data.
#
# 'name' gives the database engine to use: either 'sqlite3' (for SQLite) or
# 'psycopg2' (for PostgreSQL).
#
# 'txn_limit' gives the maximum number of transactions to run per connection
# before reconnecting. Defaults to 0, which means no limit.
#
# 'allow_unsafe_locale' is an option specific to Postgres. Under the default behavior, Synapse will refuse to
# start if the postgres db is set to a non-C locale. You can override this behavior (which is *not* recommended)
# by setting 'allow_unsafe_locale' to true. Note that doing so may corrupt your database. You can find more information
# here: https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#fixing-incorrect-collate-or-ctype and here:
# https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Locale_data_changes
#
# 'args' gives options which are passed through to the database engine,
# except for options starting 'cp_', which are used to configure the Twisted
# connection pool. For a reference to valid arguments, see:
#   * for sqlite: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect
#   * for postgres: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS
#   * for the connection pool: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool.html#__init__

#
log_config: "/data/{{ matrix_server_fqn_matrix }}.log.config"


## Ratelimiting ##

# Ratelimiting settings for client actions (registration, login, messaging).
#
# Each ratelimiting configuration is made of two parameters:
#   - per_second: number of requests a client can send per second.
#   - burst_count: number of requests a client can send before being throttled.
#
# Synapse currently uses the following configurations:
#   - one for messages that ratelimits sending based on the account the client
#     is using
#   - one for registration that ratelimits registration requests based on the
#     client's IP address.
#   - one for checking the validity of registration tokens that ratelimits
#     requests based on the client's IP address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the client's IP
#     address.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into.
#   - one for login that ratelimits login requests based on the account the
#     client is attempting to log into, based on the amount of failed login
#     attempts for this account.
#   - one for ratelimiting redactions by room admins. If this is not explicitly
#     set then it uses the same ratelimiting as per rc_message. This is useful
#     to allow room admins to deal with abuse quickly.
#   - two for ratelimiting number of rooms a user can join, "local" for when
#     users are joining rooms the server is already in (this is cheap) vs
#     "remote" for when users are trying to join rooms not on the server (which
#     can be more expensive)
#   - one for ratelimiting how often a user or IP can attempt to validate a 3PID.
#   - two for ratelimiting how often invites can be sent in a room or to a
#     specific user.
#   - one for ratelimiting 3PID invites (i.e. invites sent to a third-party ID
#     such as an email address or a phone number) based on the account that's
#     sending the invite.

# Ratelimiting settings for incoming federation
#
# The rc_federation configuration is made up of the following settings:
#   - window_size: window size in milliseconds
#   - sleep_limit: number of federation requests from a single server in
#     a window before the server will delay processing the request.
#   - sleep_delay: duration in milliseconds to delay processing events
#     from remote servers by if they go over the sleep limit.
#   - reject_limit: maximum number of concurrent federation requests
#     allowed from a single server
#   - concurrent: number of federation requests to concurrently process
#     from a single server
#
# The defaults are as shown below.

## Signing Keys ##

# Path to the signing key to sign messages with

signing_key_path: "/data/{{ matrix_server_fqn_matrix }}.signing.key"

# The keys that the server used to sign messages with but won't use
# to sign new messages.
#
old_signing_keys:
  # For each key, `key` should be the base64-encoded public key, and
  # `expired_ts`should be the time (in milliseconds since the unix epoch) that
  # it was last used.
  #
  # It is possible to build an entry from an old signing.key file using the
  # `export_signing_key` script which is provided with synapse.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #"ed25519:id": { key: "base64string", expired_ts: 123456789123 }

# How long key response published by this server is valid for.
# Used to set the valid_until_ts in /key/v2 APIs.
# Determines how quickly servers will query to check which keys
# are still valid.
#
#key_refresh_interval: 1d

# The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
#
# When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
#
# Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
# Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
# will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
#
# This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
# is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
# Options for each entry in the list include:
#
#    server_name: the name of the server. required.
#
#    verify_keys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
#       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
#       one of the given keys.
#
#    accept_keys_insecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
#       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
#       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
#       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
#       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
#       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
#       behaviour.
#
# An example configuration might look like:
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: "my_trusted_server.example.com"
#    verify_keys:
#      "ed25519:auto": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmopqr"
#  - server_name: "my_other_trusted_server.example.com"
#
trusted_key_servers: {{ matrix_synapse_trusted_key_servers|to_json }}


# Uncomment the following to disable the warning that is emitted when the
# trusted_key_servers include 'matrix.org'. See above.
#
#suppress_key_server_warning: true

# The signing keys to use when acting as a trusted key server. If not specified
# defaults to the server signing key.
#
# Can contain multiple keys, one per line.
#
#key_server_signing_keys_path: "key_server_signing_keys.key"


## Single sign-on integration ##

# The following settings can be used to make Synapse use a single sign-on
# provider for authentication, instead of its internal password database.
#
# You will probably also want to set the following options to `false` to
# disable the regular login/registration flows:
#   * enable_registration
#   * password_config.enabled
#
# You will also want to investigate the settings under the "sso" configuration
# section below.

# Enable SAML2 for registration and login. Uses pysaml2.
#
# At least one of `sp_config` or `config_path` must be set in this section to
# enable SAML login.
#
# Once SAML support is enabled, a metadata file will be exposed at
# https://<server>:<port>/_synapse/client/saml2/metadata.xml, which you may be able to
# use to configure your SAML IdP with. Alternatively, you can manually configure
# the IdP to use an ACS location of
# https://<server>:<port>/_synapse/client/saml2/authn_response.
#
saml2_config:
  # `sp_config` is the configuration for the pysaml2 Service Provider.
  # See pysaml2 docs for format of config.
  #
  # Default values will be used for the 'entityid' and 'service' settings,
  # so it is not normally necessary to specify them unless you need to
  # override them.
  #
  sp_config:
    # Point this to the IdP's metadata. You must provide either a local
    # file via the `local` attribute or (preferably) a URL via the
    # `remote` attribute.
    #
    #metadata:
    #  local: ["saml2/idp.xml"]
    #  remote:
    #    - url: https://our_idp/metadata.xml

    # Allowed clock difference in seconds between the homeserver and IdP.
    #
    # Uncomment the below to increase the accepted time difference from 0 to 3 seconds.
    #
    #accepted_time_diff: 3

    # By default, the user has to go to our login page first. If you'd like
    # to allow IdP-initiated login, set 'allow_unsolicited: true' in a
    # 'service.sp' section:
    #
    #service:
    #  sp:
    #    allow_unsolicited: true

    # The examples below are just used to generate our metadata xml, and you
    # may well not need them, depending on your setup. Alternatively you
    # may need a whole lot more detail - see the pysaml2 docs!

      #
      #mxid_mapping: dotreplace

  # In previous versions of synapse, the mapping from SAML attribute to
  # MXID was always calculated dynamically rather than stored in a
  # table. For backwards- compatibility, we will look for user_ids
  # matching such a pattern before creating a new account.
  #
  # This setting controls the SAML attribute which will be used for this
  # backwards-compatibility lookup. Typically it should be 'uid', but if
  # the attribute maps are changed, it may be necessary to change it.
  #
  # The default is 'uid'.
  #
  #grandfathered_mxid_source_attribute: upn

  # It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if SAML attributes
  # match particular values. The requirements can be listed under

  #
  #attribute_requirements:

# List of OpenID Connect (OIDC) / OAuth 2.0 identity providers, for registration
# and login.
#
# Options for each entry include:
#
#   idp_id: a unique identifier for this identity provider. Used internally
#       by Synapse; should be a single word such as 'github'.
#
#       Note that, if this is changed, users authenticating via that provider
#       will no longer be recognised as the same user!
#
#       (Use "oidc" here if you are migrating from an old "oidc_config"
#       configuration.)
#
#   idp_name: A user-facing name for this identity provider, which is used to
#       offer the user a choice of login mechanisms.
#
#   idp_icon: An optional icon for this identity provider, which is presented
#       by clients and Synapse's own IdP picker page. If given, must be an
#       MXC URI of the format mxc://<server-name>/<media-id>. (An easy way to
#       obtain such an MXC URI is to upload an image to an (unencrypted) room
#       and then copy the "url" from the source of the event.)
#
#   idp_brand: An optional brand for this identity provider, allowing clients
#       to style the login flow according to the identity provider in question.
#       See the spec for possible options here.
#
#   discover: set to 'false' to disable the use of the OIDC discovery mechanism
#       to discover endpoints. Defaults to true.
#
#   issuer: Required. The OIDC issuer. Used to validate tokens and (if discovery
#       is enabled) to discover the provider's endpoints.
#
#   client_id: Required. oauth2 client id to use.
#
#   client_secret: oauth2 client secret to use. May be omitted if
#        client_secret_jwt_key is given, or if client_auth_method is 'none'.
#
#   client_secret_jwt_key: Alternative to client_secret: details of a key used
#      to create a JSON Web Token to be used as an OAuth2 client secret. If
#      given, must be a dictionary with the following properties:
#
#          key: a pem-encoded signing key. Must be a suitable key for the
#              algorithm specified. Required unless 'key_file' is given.
#
#          key_file: the path to file containing a pem-encoded signing key file.
#              Required unless 'key' is given.
#
#          jwt_header: a dictionary giving properties to include in the JWT
#              header. Must include the key 'alg', giving the algorithm used to
#              sign the JWT, such as "ES256", using the JWA identifiers in
#              RFC7518.
#
#          jwt_payload: an optional dictionary giving properties to include in
#              the JWT payload. Normally this should include an 'iss' key.
#
#   client_auth_method: auth method to use when exchanging the token. Valid
#       values are 'client_secret_basic' (default), 'client_secret_post' and
#       'none'.
#
#   scopes: list of scopes to request. This should normally include the "openid"
#       scope. Defaults to ["openid"].
#
#   authorization_endpoint: the oauth2 authorization endpoint. Required if
#       provider discovery is disabled.
#
#   token_endpoint: the oauth2 token endpoint. Required if provider discovery is
#       disabled.
#
#   userinfo_endpoint: the OIDC userinfo endpoint. Required if discovery is
#       disabled and the 'openid' scope is not requested.
#
#   jwks_uri: URI where to fetch the JWKS. Required if discovery is disabled and
#       the 'openid' scope is used.
#
#   skip_verification: set to 'true' to skip metadata verification. Use this if
#       you are connecting to a provider that is not OpenID Connect compliant.
#       Defaults to false. Avoid this in production.
#
#   user_profile_method: Whether to fetch the user profile from the userinfo
#       endpoint, or to rely on the data returned in the id_token from the
#       token_endpoint.
#
#       Valid values are: 'auto' or 'userinfo_endpoint'.
#
#       Defaults to 'auto', which uses the userinfo endpoint if 'openid' is
#       not included in 'scopes'. Set to 'userinfo_endpoint' to always use the
#       userinfo endpoint.
#
#   allow_existing_users: set to 'true' to allow a user logging in via OIDC to
#       match a pre-existing account instead of failing. This could be used if
#       switching from password logins to OIDC. Defaults to false.
#
#   user_mapping_provider: Configuration for how attributes returned from a OIDC
#       provider are mapped onto a matrix user. This setting has the following
#       sub-properties:
#
#       module: The class name of a custom mapping module. Default is
#           'synapse.handlers.oidc.JinjaOidcMappingProvider'.
#           See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/sso_mapping_providers.html#openid-mapping-providers
#           for information on implementing a custom mapping provider.
#
#       config: Configuration for the mapping provider module. This section will
#           be passed as a Python dictionary to the user mapping provider
#           module's `parse_config` method.
#
#           For the default provider, the following settings are available:
#
#             subject_claim: name of the claim containing a unique identifier
#                 for the user. Defaults to 'sub', which OpenID Connect
#                 compliant providers should provide.
#
#             localpart_template: Jinja2 template for the localpart of the MXID.
#                 If this is not set, the user will be prompted to choose their
#                 own username (see the documentation for the
#                 'sso_auth_account_details.html' template). This template can
#                 use the 'localpart_from_email' filter.
#
#             confirm_localpart: Whether to prompt the user to validate (or

#   It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if certain attributes
#   match particular values in the OIDC userinfo. The requirements can be listed under
#   `attribute_requirements` as shown below. All of the listed attributes must
#   match for the login to be permitted. Additional attributes can be added to
#   userinfo by expanding the `scopes` section of the OIDC config to retrieve
#   additional information from the OIDC provider.
#
#   If the OIDC claim is a list, then the attribute must match any value in the list.
#   Otherwise, it must exactly match the value of the claim. Using the example
#   below, the `family_name` claim MUST be "Stephensson", but the `groups`
#   claim MUST contain "admin".

#     - attribute: family_name

#
# See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/openid.html
# for information on how to configure these options.
#
# For backwards compatibility, it is also possible to configure a single OIDC
# provider via an 'oidc_config' setting. This is now deprecated and admins are
# advised to migrate to the 'oidc_providers' format. (When doing that migration,
# use 'oidc' for the idp_id to ensure that existing users continue to be

# Server Notices room configuration
#
# Uncomment this section to enable a room which can be used to send notices
# from the server to users. It is a special room which cannot be left; notices
# come from a special "notices" user id.
#
# If you uncomment this section, you *must* define the system_mxid_localpart
# setting, which defines the id of the user which will be used to send the
# notices.
#
# It's also possible to override the room name, the display name of the
# "notices" user, and the avatar for the user.

# The `alias_creation` option controls who's allowed to create aliases
# on this server.
#
# The format of this option is a list of rules that contain globs that

# server name). The action in the first rule that matches is taken,
# which can currently either be "allow" or "deny".
#
# Missing user_id/room_id/alias fields default to "*".
#
# If no rules match the request is denied. An empty list means no one
# can create aliases.
#
# Options for the rules include:

#   user_id: Matches against the creator of the alias
#   alias: Matches against the alias being created
#   room_id: Matches against the room ID the alias is being pointed at
#   action: Whether to "allow" or "deny" the request if the rule matches

## Opentracing ##

# These settings enable opentracing, which implements distributed tracing.
# This allows you to observe the causal chains of events across servers
# including requests, key lookups etc., across any server running
# synapse or any other other services which supports opentracing
# (specifically those implemented with Jaeger).
#

    # tracing is disabled by default. Uncomment the following line to enable it.

## Workers ##

# started, to ensure that all instances are running with the same config (otherwise
# events may be dropped).

## Background Updates ##

# Background updates are database updates that are run in the background in batches.
