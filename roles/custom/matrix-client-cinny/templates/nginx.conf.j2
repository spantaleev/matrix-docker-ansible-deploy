#jinja2: lstrip_blocks: "True"
# This is a custom nginx configuration file that we use in the container (instead of the default one),
# because it allows us to run nginx with a non-root user.
#
# For this to work, the default vhost file (`/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`) also needs to be removed.
# (mounting `/dev/null` over `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` works well)
#
# The following changes have been done compared to a default nginx configuration file:
# - default server port is changed (80 -> 8080), so that a non-root user can bind it
# - various temp paths are changed to `/tmp`, so that a non-root user can write to them
# - the `user` directive was removed, as we don't want nginx to switch users
