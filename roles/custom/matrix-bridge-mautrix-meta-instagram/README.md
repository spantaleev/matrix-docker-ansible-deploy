# matrix-mautrix-meta-instagram

This bridge role is derived from the matrix-mautrix-meta-messenger Ansible role via automatic changes (see `just rebuild-mautrix-meta-instagram` or `bin/rebuild-mautrix-meta-instagram.sh`).

If you'd like to make a change to this role, consider making it to the `matrix-mautrix-meta-messenger` role instead.
