# A case-insensitive list of ban reasons to have the bot also automatically redact the user's messages for.
#
# If the bot sees you ban a user with a reason that is an (exact case-insensitive) match to this list,
# it will also remove the user's messages automatically.
#
# Typically this is useful to avoid having to give two commands to the bot.
# Advanced: Use asterisks to have the reason match using "globs"
# (f.e. "spam*testing" would match "spam for testing" as well as "spamtesting").

# See here for more info: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob
# Note: Keep in mind that glob is NOT regex!
