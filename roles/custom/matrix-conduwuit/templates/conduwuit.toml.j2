# Database recovery mode (for RocksDB WAL corruption).

# minutes prior to the crash. Clients may have to run "clear-cache &
# reload" to account for the rollback. Upon success, you may reset the
# mode back to default and restart again. Please note in some cases the
# corruption error may not be cleared for at least 30 minutes of operation
# in PointInTime mode.
#
# As a very last ditch effort, if PointInTime does not fix or resolve
# anything, you can try mode 3 (SkipAnyCorruptedRecord) but this will
# leave the server in a potentially inconsistent state.
#
# The default mode 1 (TolerateCorruptedTailRecords) will automatically

# queue (see: db_pool_queue_mult) as any larger value will stall the tokio
# task. The value can also be scaled down (e.g. 0.5)  to improve
# responsiveness for many users at the cost of throughput for each.

# Sets the initial amplification factor. This controls batch sizes of

# queue size. This is because each database query may require several
# index lookups, thus many database queries in a batch may make progress
# independently while also sharing index and data blocks which may or may
