# Controls if the old apt repository (likely without a `signed-by` option) on Debian-based systems will be removed.
#
# Older versions of the Docker role (5.x, 6.x) used to install a repository at a path like: `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/download_docker_com_linux_*`
# For 6.x, the repository included a `signed-by` option, but for earlier versions it did not.
#
# New versions of the Docker role (7.0+) install a new apt repository with `signed-by` option to a different path (`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list`),
# but if a non-signed-by repository exists at the old path, a conflict will arise.
#
# Our workaround is to just delete the old repository file. Later, when the Docker role runs, it will install a new one at the new path.
