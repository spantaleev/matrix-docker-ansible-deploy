# ansible-role-docker creates the Docker daemon options file (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) when options are set
# via `matrix_playbook_docker_installation_daemon_options` (which influences the `docker_daemon_options` variable of the role).
# See: https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker/blob/acade8d01f11bcd5efecba6d8211138d7567ce4b/tasks/main.yml#L53-L66
#
# However, it doesn't delete the file when the options list is empty.
#
# This means that people who previously force-disabled IPv6 (and injected `{'ipv6': false}` options, etc)
# or had some other custom options had that file created for them.
# Later, when they stopped setting these options, they were stuck with the configuration file that still retained them.
#
# Here, we make the file go away of no options are set.
# Ideally, this task would be part of the `ansible-role-docker` role, but it's not (yet).
# See: https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker/pull/498
