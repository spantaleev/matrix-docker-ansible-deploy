#     botConfig:
#       # Enable the presence of the bot in IRC channels. The bot serves as the entity
#       # which maps from IRC -> Matrix. You can disable the bot entirely which

#       # in the room. If there are no users in the room (or if there are users
#       # but their connections are not on IRC) then nothing will be bridged to
#       # Matrix. If you're concerned about the bot being treated as a "logger"
#       # entity, then you may want to disable the bot. If you want IRC->Matrix
#       # but don't want to have TCP connections to IRC unless a Matrix user speaks
#       # (because your client connection limit is low), then you may want to keep

#       # The number of concurrent reconnects if a user has been disconnected unexpectedly
