# matrix-user-creator is a role that aims to automate initial Matrix user account creation.
#
# This role only supports initial user account creation and will not manage subsequent user-type changes
# or password changes.
#
# The playbook registers various bot user accounts automatically using this role by injecting
# user creation definitions into the `matrix_user_creator_users_auto` variable.
#
# To get started creating your own Matrix user accounts, use the `matrix_user_creator_users_additional` variable.

# matrix_user_creator_users_auto holds a list of users that should be created on the Matrix homeserver.
# The playbook adds some user definitions here to have them end up in `matrix_user_creator_users` (see `vars/main.yml`) and get automatically created.
# This value is influenced by the playbook and will be overwritten elsewhere (`group_vars/`, etc.)
# To add your own user definitions, use the `matrix_user_creator_users_additional` variable.
