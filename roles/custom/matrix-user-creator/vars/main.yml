# matrix_user_creator_users holds a list of users that should be created on the Matrix homeserver.
#
# Removing a user from this list will not automatically delete/disable the Matrix user on the homeserver.
#
# As the `initial_password` / `initial_type` field names indicate, these are just initial values.
# Changing the password or type values subsequently will not update the already existing user's details.
#
# The known user types are: 'admin', 'user', 'bot', 'support'.
# These are inspired by Synapse's user types.
# 'admin' and 'user' types are generally recognized across homeservers.
# Other homeservers may not support 'bot' and 'support'. Such homeservers will fall back to whatever types they do support.
#
# Example:
# matrix_user_creator_users:
#   - username: root
#     initial_password: some-password
#     initial_type: admin
#
#   - username: john
#     initial_password: some-password
#     initial_type: user
#
#   - username: bot.matrix-reminder-bot
#     initial_password: some-password
#     initial_type: bot
#
#   - username: bot.matrix-reminder-bot
#     initial_password: some-password
#     initial_type: support
#
# To create you own users, use the `matrix_user_creator_users_additional` variable.
matrix_user_creator_users: "{{ matrix_user_creator_users_auto + matrix_user_creator_users_additional }}"
