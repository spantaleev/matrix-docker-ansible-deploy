NOTE: our FAQ page is available at https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/faq.md. It contains a list of questions and answers about configuration, installation, troubleshooting, etc. Before creating a new issue, you are encouraged to have a look at it.

Also you can usually get more timely support and from more people by joining our Matrix room (also bridged to IRC). See the support section of our README.

**Playbook Configuration**:

My `vars.yml` file looks like this:
