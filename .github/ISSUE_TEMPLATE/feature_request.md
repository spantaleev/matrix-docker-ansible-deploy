NOTE: When submitting feature requests, be aware that:

- This Ansible playbook installs tens of separate services. If you're having a problem with a specific one, it is likely that the problem is with the service itself. You may wish to report that problem at the source, upstream.

- This playbook intends to focus solely on Matrix and Matrix-related services. If your request is not specific to them, you may as well to consider to submit it to the mash-playbook project: https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook

- This is a community project with no financial backing. The easiest way to get a feature into this project is to just develop it yourself.
