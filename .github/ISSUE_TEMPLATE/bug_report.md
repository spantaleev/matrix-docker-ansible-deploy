**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

<!--
NOTE: This Ansible playbook installs tens of separate services. If you're having a problem with a specific one, it is likely that the problem is with the service itself. You may wish to report that problem at the source, upstream.
-->

**To Reproduce**
My `vars.yml` file looks like this:

```yaml
Paste your vars.yml file here.
Make sure to remove any secret values before posting your vars.yml file publicly.
```

<!-- Below this line, tell us what you're doing to reproduce the problem. -->


**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Matrix Server:**
 - OS: [e.g. Ubuntu 21.04]
 - Architecture [e.g. amd64, arm32, arm64]

**Ansible:**
If your problem appears to be with Ansible, tell us:
- where you run Ansible -- e.g. on the Matrix server itself; on another computer (which OS? distro? standard installation or containerized Ansible?)
- what version of Ansible you're running (see `ansible --version`)
