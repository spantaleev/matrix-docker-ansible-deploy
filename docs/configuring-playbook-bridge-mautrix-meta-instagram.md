# Setting up Instagram bridging via Mautrix Meta (optional)

The playbook can install and configure the [mautrix-meta](https://github.com/mautrix/meta) Messenger/Instagram bridge for you.

Since this bridge component can bridge to both [Messenger](https://messenger.com/) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/) and you may wish to do both at the same time, the playbook makes it available via 2 different Ansible roles (`matrix-bridge-mautrix-meta-messenger` and `matrix-bridge-mautrix-meta-instagram`). The latter is a reconfigured copy of the first one (created by `just rebuild-mautrix-meta-instagram` and `bin/rebuild-mautrix-meta-instagram.sh`).

This documentation page only deals with the bridge's ability to bridge to Instagram. For bridging to Facebook/Messenger, see [Setting up Messenger bridging via Mautrix Meta](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-meta-messenger.md).

## Prerequisites

### Migrating from the old mautrix-instagram bridge

If you've been using the [mautrix-instagram](./configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-instagram.md) bridge, **you'd better get rid of it first** or the 2 bridges will be in conflict:

- both trying to use `@instagrambot:example.com` as their username. This conflict may be resolved by adjusting `matrix_mautrix_instagram_appservice_bot_username` or `matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_appservice_username`
- both trying to bridge the same DMs

To do so, send a `clean-rooms` command to the management room with the old bridge bot (`@instagrambot:example.com`). It gives you a list of portals and groups of portals you may purge. Proceed with sending commands like `clean recommended`, etc.

Then, consider disabling the old bridge in your configuration, so it won't recreate the portals when you receive new messages.

### Enable Appservice Double Puppet (optional)

If you want to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do) for this bridge automatically, you need to have enabled [Appservice Double Puppet](configuring-playbook-appservice-double-puppet.md) service for this playbook.

For details about configuring Double Puppeting for this bridge, see the section below: [Set up Double Puppeting](#-set-up-double-puppeting)

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable the bridge, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_enabled: true
```

Before proceeding to [re-running the playbook](./installing.md), you may wish to adjust the configuration further. See below.

### Bridge permissions

By default, any user on your homeserver will be able to use the bridge.

Different levels of permission can be granted to users:

- `relay` - Allowed to be relayed through the bridge, no access to commands
- `user` - Use the bridge with puppeting
- `admin` - Use and administer the bridge

The permissions are following the sequence: nothing < `relay` < `user` < `admin`.

The default permissions are set via `matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_bridge_permissions_default` and are somewhat like this:
```yaml
matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_bridge_permissions_default:
  '*': relay
  example.com: user
  '{{ matrix_admin }}': admin
```

If you don't define the `matrix_admin` in your configuration (e.g. `matrix_admin: @user:example.com`), then there's no admin by default.

You may redefine `matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_bridge_permissions_default` any way you see fit, or add extra permissions using `matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_bridge_permissions_custom` like this:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_meta_instagram_bridge_permissions_custom:
  '@YOUR_USERNAME:example.com': admin
```

You may wish to look at `roles/custom/matrix-bridge-mautrix-meta-instagram/templates/config.yaml.j2` to find more information on the permissions settings and other options you would like to configure.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run it with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,ensure-matrix-users-created,start
```

**Notes**:

- The `ensure-matrix-users-created` playbook tag makes the playbook automatically create the bot's user account.

- The shortcut commands with the [`just` program](just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

  `just install-all` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just setup-all`, or these components will still remain installed.

## Usage

You then need to start a chat with `@instagrambot:example.com` (where `example.com` is your base domain, not the `matrix.` domain).

### ðŸ’¡ Set up Double Puppeting

After successfully enabling bridging, you may wish to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do).

To set it up, you have 2 ways of going about it.

#### Method 1: automatically, by enabling Appservice Double Puppet

The bridge automatically performs Double Puppeting if [Appservice Double Puppet](configuring-playbook-appservice-double-puppet.md) service is configured and enabled on the server for this playbook.

This is the recommended way of setting up Double Puppeting, as it's easier to accomplish, works for all your users automatically, and has less of a chance of breaking in the future.

#### Method 2: manually, by asking each user to provide a working access token

When using this method, **each user** that wishes to enable Double Puppeting needs to follow the following steps:

- retrieve a Matrix access token for yourself. Refer to the documentation on [how to do that](obtaining-access-tokens.md).

- send the access token to the bot. Example: `login-matrix MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE`

- make sure you don't log out the session for which you obtained an access token some time in the future, as that would break the Double Puppeting feature
