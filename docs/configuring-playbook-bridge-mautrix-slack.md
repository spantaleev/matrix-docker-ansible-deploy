# Setting up Mautrix Slack bridging (optional)

**Note**: bridging to [Slack](https://slack.com/) can also happen via the [mx-puppet-slack](configuring-playbook-bridge-mx-puppet-slack.md) and [matrix-appservice-slack](configuring-playbook-bridge-appservice-slack.md) bridges supported by the playbook.
- For using as a Bot we recommend the [Appservice Slack](configuring-playbook-bridge-appservice-slack.md), because it supports plumbing. Note that it is not available for new installation unless you have already created a classic Slack application, because the creation of classic Slack applications, which this bridge makes use of, has been discontinued.
- For personal use with a slack account we recommend the `mautrix-slack` bridge (the one being discussed here), because it is the most fully-featured and stable of the 3 Slack bridges supported by the playbook.

The playbook can install and configure [mautrix-slack](https://github.com/mautrix/slack) for you.

See the project's [documentation](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/slack/index.html) to learn what it does and why it might be useful to you.

See the [features and roadmap](https://github.com/mautrix/slack/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for more information.


## Prerequisites

For using this bridge, you would need to authenticate by **providing your username and password** (legacy) or by using a **token login**. See more information in the [docs](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/slack/authentication.html).

Note that neither of these methods are officially supported by Slack. [matrix-appservice-slack](configuring-playbook-bridge-appservice-slack.md) uses a Slack bot account which is the only officially supported method for bridging a Slack channel.

### Enable Appservice Double Puppet (optional)

If you want to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do) for this bridge automatically, you need to have enabled [Appservice Double Puppet](configuring-playbook-appservice-double-puppet.md) service for this playbook.

For details about configuring Double Puppeting for this bridge, see the section below: [Set up Double Puppeting](#-set-up-double-puppeting)

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable the bridge, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_slack_enabled: true
```

You may optionally wish to add some [Additional configuration](#additional-configuration), or to [prepare for double-puppeting](#set-up-double-puppeting) before the initial installation.

### Additional configuration

There are some additional options you may wish to configure with the bridge.

Take a look at:

- `roles/custom/matrix-bridge-mautrix-slack/defaults/main.yml` for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file
- `roles/custom/matrix-bridge-mautrix-slack/templates/config.yaml.j2` for the bridge's default configuration. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `matrix_mautrix_slack_configuration_extension_yaml` variable

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run it with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,ensure-matrix-users-created,start
```

**Notes**:

- The `ensure-matrix-users-created` playbook tag makes the playbook automatically create the bot's user account.

- The shortcut commands with the [`just` program](just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

  `just install-all` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just setup-all`, or these components will still remain installed.

## Usage

1. Start a chat with `@slackbot:example.com` (where `example.com` is your base domain, not the `matrix.` domain).
2. If you would like to login to Slack using a token, send the `login-token` command, otherwise, send the `login-password` command. Read [here](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/slack/authentication.html) on how to retrieve your token and cookie token.
3. The bot should respond with "Successfully logged into <email> for team <workspace>"
4. Now that you're logged in, you can send a `help` command to the bot again, to see additional commands you have access to.
5. Slack channels should automatically begin bridging if you authenticated using a token. Otherwise, you must wait to receive a message in the channel if you used password authentication.

### ðŸ’¡ Set up Double Puppeting

After successfully enabling bridging, you may wish to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do).

To set it up, you have 2 ways of going about it.

#### Method 1: automatically, by enabling Appservice Double Puppet

The bridge automatically performs Double Puppeting if [Appservice Double Puppet](configuring-playbook-appservice-double-puppet.md) service is configured and enabled on the server for this playbook.

This is the recommended way of setting up Double Puppeting, as it's easier to accomplish, works for all your users automatically, and has less of a chance of breaking in the future.

#### Method 2: manually, by asking each user to provide a working access token

When using this method, **each user** that wishes to enable Double Puppeting needs to follow the following steps:

- retrieve a Matrix access token for yourself. Refer to the documentation on [how to do that](obtaining-access-tokens.md).

- send the access token to the bot. Example: `login-matrix MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE`

- make sure you don't log out the `Mautrix-Slack` device some time in the future, as that would break the Double Puppeting feature
