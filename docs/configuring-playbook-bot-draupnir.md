# Setting up Draupnir (optional)

The playbook can install and configure the [Draupnir](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir) moderation bot for you.

See the project's [documentation](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/blob/main/README.md) to learn what it does and why it might be useful to you.

This documentation page is about installing Draupnir in bot mode. As an alternative, you can run a multi-instance Draupnir deployment by installing [Draupnir in appservice mode](./configuring-playbook-appservice-draupnir-for-all.md) (called Draupnir-for-all) instead.

If your migrating from Mjolnir skip to [this section](#migrating-from-mjolnir-only-required-if-migrating).

## Prerequisites

### Register the bot account

The playbook does not automatically create users for you. You **need to register the bot user manually** before setting up the bot.

Generate a strong password for the bot. You can create one with a command like `pwgen -s 64 1`.

You can use the playbook to [register a new user](registering-users.md):

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --extra-vars='username=bot.draupnir password=PASSWORD_FOR_THE_BOT admin=no' --tags=register-user
```

If you would like Draupnir to be able to deactivate users, move aliases, shutdown rooms, show abuse reports (see [below](#abuse-reports)), etc then it must be a server admin so you need to change `admin=no` to `admin=yes` in the command above.

### Obtain an access token

The bot requires an access token to be able to connect to your homeserver. Refer to the documentation on [how to obtain an access token](obtaining-access-tokens.md).

⚠️ **Warning**: Access tokens are sensitive information. Do not include them in any bug reports, messages, or logs. Do not share the access token with anyone.

### Make sure the account is free from rate limiting

If your homeserver's implementation is Synapse, you will need to prevent it from rate limiting the bot's account. **This is a required step. If you do not configure it, Draupnir will crash.**

This can be done using Synapse's [Admin APIs](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#override-ratelimiting-for-users). They can be accessed both externally and internally.

To expose the APIs publicly, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_synapse_container_labels_public_client_synapse_admin_api_enabled: true
```

The APIs can also be accessed via [Synapse Admin](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin), a web UI tool you can use to administrate users, rooms, media, etc. on your Matrix server. The playbook can install and configure Synapse Admin for you. For details about it, see [this page](configuring-playbook-synapse-admin.md).

**Note**: access to the APIs is restricted with a valid access token, so exposing them publicly should not be a real security concern. Still, doing so is not recommended for additional security. See [official Synapse reverse-proxying recommendations](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/reverse_proxy.html#synapse-administration-endpoints).

To discharge rate limiting, run the following command on systems that ship curl (note that it does not work on outdated Windows 10). Even if the APIs are not exposed to the internet, you should still be able to run the command on the homeserver locally. Before running it, make sure to replace `@bot.draupnir:example.com` with the MXID of your Draupnir:

```sh
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" -X POST https://matrix.example.com/_synapse/admin/v1/users/@bot.draupnir:example.com/override_ratelimit
```

You can obtain an access token for a homeserver admin account in the same way as you can do so for Draupnir itself. If you have made Draupnir an admin, you can just use the Draupnir token.

### Create a management room

Using your own account, create a new invite only room that you will use to manage the bot. This is the room where you will see the status of the bot and where you will send commands to the bot, such as the command to ban a user from another room. Anyone in this room can control the bot so it is important that you only invite trusted users to this room.

If you make the management room encrypted (E2EE), then you MUST enable and use Pantalaimon (see [below](#configuration-with-e2ee-support)).

Once you have created the room you need to copy the room ID so you can tell the bot to use that room. In Element Web you can do this by going to the room's settings, clicking Advanced, and then copying the internal room ID. The room ID will look something like `!qporfwt:example.com`.

Finally invite the `@bot.draupnir:example.com` account you created earlier into the room.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable the bot, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `MANAGEMENT_ROOM_ID_HERE`.

```yaml
# Enable Draupnir
matrix_bot_draupnir_enabled: true

matrix_bot_draupnir_management_room: "MANAGEMENT_ROOM_ID_HERE"
```

### End-to-End Encryption support

Decide whether you want Draupnir to be capable of operating in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) rooms. This includes the management room and the moderated rooms.

To support E2EE, Draupnir needs to [use Pantalaimon](configuring-playbook-pantalaimon.md).

#### Configuration with E2EE support

When using Pantalaimon, Draupnir will log in to its bot account itself through Pantalaimon, so configure its username and password.

Add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
# Enable Pantalaimon. See docs/configuring-playbook-pantalaimon.md
matrix_pantalaimon_enabled: true

# Tell Draupnir to use Pantalaimon
matrix_bot_draupnir_pantalaimon_use: true

# User name and password for the bot you have created above. Required when using Pantalaimon.
matrix_bot_draupnir_pantalaimon_username: "bot.draupnir"
matrix_bot_draupnir_pantalaimon_password: "PASSWORD_FOR_THE_BOT"
```

The playbook's `group_vars` will configure other required settings. If using this role separately without the playbook, you also need to configure the two URLs that Draupnir uses to reach the homeserver, one through Pantalaimon and one "raw". This example is taken from the playbook's `group_vars`:

```yaml
# Endpoint URL that Draupnir uses to interact with the Matrix homeserver (client-server API).
# Set this to the pantalaimon URL if you're using that.
matrix_bot_draupnir_homeserver_url: "{{ 'http://matrix-pantalaimon:8009' if matrix_bot_draupnir_pantalaimon_use else matrix_addons_homeserver_client_api_url }}"

# Endpoint URL that Draupnir could use to fetch events related to reports (client-server API and /_synapse/),
# only set this to the public-internet homeserver client API URL, do NOT set this to the pantalaimon URL.
matrix_bot_draupnir_raw_homeserver_url: "{{ matrix_addons_homeserver_client_api_url }}"
```

#### Configuration without E2EE support

When NOT using Pantalaimon, Draupnir does not log in by itself and you must give it an access token for its bot account.

Add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE` with the one created [above](#obtain-an-access-token).

```yaml
matrix_bot_draupnir_access_token: "ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Abuse Reports

Draupnir supports two methods to receive reports in the management room.

The first method intercepts the report API endpoint of the client-server API, which requires integration with the reverse proxy in front of the homeserver. If you are using traefik, this playbook can set this up for you:

```yaml
matrix_bot_draupnir_abuse_reporting_enabled: true
```

The other method polls an Synapse Admin API endpoint, hence it is available only if using Synapse and if the Draupnir user is an admin (see [above](#register-the-bot-account)). To enable it, set `pollReports: true` on `vars.yml` file as below.

### Extending the configuration

You can configure additional options by adding the `matrix_bot_draupnir_configuration_extension_yaml` variable.

For example, to change Draupnir's `pollReports` option to `true`, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_bot_draupnir_configuration_extension_yaml: |
  # Your custom YAML configuration goes here.
  # This configuration extends the default starting configuration (`matrix_bot_draupnir_configuration_yaml`).
  #
  # You can override individual variables from the default configuration, or introduce new ones.
  #
  # If you need something more special, you can take full control by
  # completely redefining `matrix_bot_draupnir_configuration_yaml`.
  pollReports: true
```

### Migrating from Mjolnir (Only required if migrating)

Replace your `matrix_bot_mjolnir` config with `matrix_bot_draupnir` config. Also disable Mjolnir if you're doing migration.

That is all you need to do due to that Draupnir can complete migration on its own.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run it with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,ensure-matrix-users-created,start
```

**Notes**:

- The `ensure-matrix-users-created` playbook tag makes the playbook automatically create the bot's user account.

- The shortcut commands with the [`just` program](just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

  `just install-all` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly ([2x-5x faster](../CHANGELOG.md#2x-5x-performance-improvements-in-playbook-runtime) than `just setup-all`) when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just setup-all`, or these components will still remain installed.

- If you change the Pantalaimon's password (`matrix_bot_draupnir_pantalaimon_password` in your `vars.yml` file) subsequently, its credentials on the homeserver won't be updated automatically. If you'd like to change the password, use a tool like [synapse-admin](configuring-playbook-synapse-admin.md) to change it, and then update `matrix_bot_draupnir_pantalaimon_password` to let Pantalaimon know its new password.

## Usage

You can refer to the upstream [documentation](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/) for additional ways to use and configure Draupnir and for a more detailed usage guide.

Below is a **non-exhaustive quick-start guide** for the impatient.

### Making Draupnir join and protect a room

Draupnir can be told to self-join public rooms, but it's better to follow this flow which works well for all kinds of rooms:

1. Invite the bot to the room manually ([inviting Draupnir to rooms](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-protected-rooms#inviting-draupnir-to-rooms)). Before joining, the bot *may* ask for confirmation in the Management Room

2. [Give the bot permissions to do its job](#giving-draupnir-permissions-to-do-its-job)

3. Tell it to protect the room (using the [rooms command](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-protected-rooms#using-the-draupnir-rooms-command)) by sending the following command to the Management Room: `!draupnir rooms add !qporfwt:example.com`

To have Draupnir provide useful room protection, you need do to a bit more work (at least the first time around). You may wish to [Subscribe to a public policy list](#subscribing-to-a-public-policy-list), [Create your own own policy and rules](#creating-your-own-policy-lists-and-rules) and [Enabling built-in protections](#enabling-built-in-protections).

### Giving Draupnir permissions to do its job

For Draupnir to do its job, you need to [give it permissions](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-protected-rooms#giving-draupnir-permissions) in rooms it's protecting. This involves **giving it an Administrator power level**.

**We recommend setting this power level as soon as the bot joins your room** (and before you create new rules), so that it can apply rules as soon as they are available. If the bot is under-privileged, it may fail to apply protections and may not retry for a while (or until your restart it).

### Subscribing to a public policy list

We recommend **subscribing to a public [policy list](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/concepts/policy-lists)** using the [watch command](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-policy-lists#using-draupnirs-watch-command-to-subscribe-to-policy-rooms).

Polcy lists are maintained in Matrix rooms. A popular policy list is maintained in the public `#community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev` room.

You can tell Draupnir to subscribe to it by sending the following command to the Management Room: `!draupnir watch #community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev`

#### Creating your own policy lists and rules

We also recommend **creating your own policy lists** with the [list create](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-policy-lists#using-draupnirs-list-create-command-to-create-a-policy-room) command.

You can do so by sending the following command to the Management Room: `!draupnir list create my-bans my-bans-bl`. This will create a policy list having a name (shortcode) of `my-bans` and stored in a public `#my-bans-bl:example.com` room on your server. As soon as you run this command, the bot will invite you to the policy list room.

A policy list does nothing by itself, so the next step is **adding some rules to your policy list**. Policies target a so-called `entity` (one of: `user`, `room` or `server`). These entities are mentioned on the [policy lists](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/concepts/policy-lists) documentation page and in the Matrix Spec [here](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#mban-recommendation).

The simplest and most useful entity to target is `user`. Below are a few examples using the [ban command](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-users#the-ban-command) and targeting users.

To create rules, you run commands in the Management Room (**not** in the policy list room).

- (ban a single user on a given homeserver): `!draupnir ban @charles:example.com my-bans Rude to others`
- (ban all users on a given homeserver by using a [wildcard](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-users#wildcards)): `!draupnir ban @*:example.org my-bans Spam server - all users are fake`

As a result of running these commands, you may observe:

- Draupnir creating `m.policy.rule.user` state events in the `#my-bans-bl:example.com` room on your server
- applying these rules against all rooms that Draupnir is an Administrator in

You can undo bans with the [unban command](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/managing-users#the-unban-command).

### Enabling built-in protections

You can also **turn on various built-in [protections](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/protections)** like `JoinWaveShortCircuit` ("If X amount of users join in Y time, set the room to invite-only").

To **see which protections are available and which are enabled**, send a `!draupnir protections` command to the Management Room.

To **see the configuration options for a given protection**, send a `!draupnir config get PROTECTION_NAME` (e.g. `!draupnir config get JoinWaveShortCircuit`).

To **set a specific option for a given protection**, send a command like this: `!draupnir config set PROTECTION_NAME.OPTION VALUE` (e.g. `!draupnir config set JoinWaveShortCircuit.timescaleMinutes 30`).

To **enable a given protection**, send a command like this: `!draupnir enable PROTECTION_NAME` (e.g. `!draupnir enable JoinWaveShortCircuit`).

To **disable a given protection**, send a command like this: `!draupnir disable PROTECTION_NAME` (e.g. `!draupnir disable JoinWaveShortCircuit`).
