# Setting up Mautrix Whatsapp (optional)

The playbook can install and configure [mautrix-whatsapp](https://github.com/mautrix/whatsapp) for you.

See the project's [documentation](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/whatsapp/index.html) to learn what it does and why it might be useful to you.

Use the following playbook configuration:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_whatsapp_enabled: true
``` 
Whatsapp multidevice beta is required, now it is enough if Whatsapp is connected to the Internet every 2 weeks.

## Enable backfilling history
This requires a server with MSC2716 support, which is currently an experimental feature in synapse.
Note that as of Synapse 1.46, there are still some bugs with the implementation, especially if using event persistence workers.
Use the following playbook configuration:

```yaml
matrix_synapse_configuration_extension_yaml: |
  experimental_features:
    msc2716_enabled: true
```
```yaml
matrix_mautrix_whatsapp_configuration_extension_yaml:
  bridge:
    history_sync:
      backfill: true
```

## Set up Double Puppeting

If you'd like to use [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do), you have 2 ways of going about it.

### Method 1: automatically, by enabling Shared Secret Auth

The bridge will automatically perform Double Puppeting if you enable [Shared Secret Auth](configuring-playbook-shared-secret-auth.md) for this playbook.

This is the recommended way of setting up Double Puppeting, as it's easier to accomplish, works for all your users automatically, and has less of a chance of breaking in the future.

### Method 2: manually, by asking each user to provide a working access token

**Note**: This method for enabling Double Puppeting can be configured only after you've already set up bridging (see [Usage](#usage)).

When using this method, **each user** that wishes to enable Double Puppeting needs to follow the following steps:

- retrieve a Matrix access token for yourself. You can use the following command:

```
curl \
--data '{"identifier": {"type": "m.id.user", "user": "YOUR_MATRIX_USERNAME" }, "password": "YOUR_MATRIX_PASSWORD", "type": "m.login.password", "device_id": "Mautrix-Whatsapp", "initial_device_display_name": "Mautrix-Whatsapp"}' \
https://matrix.DOMAIN/_matrix/client/r0/login
```

- send the access token to the bot. Example: `login-matrix MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE`

- make sure you don't log out the `Mautrix-Whatsapp` device some time in the future, as that would break the Double Puppeting feature


## Usage

You then need to start a chat with `@whatsappbot:YOUR_DOMAIN` (where `YOUR_DOMAIN` is your base domain, not the `matrix.` domain).
