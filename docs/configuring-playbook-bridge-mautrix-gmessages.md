# Setting up Mautrix Google Messages bridging (optional)

The playbook can install and configure [mautrix-gmessages](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages) for you, for bridging to [Google Messages](https://messages.google.com/).

See the project's [documentation](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/gmessages/index.html) to learn what it does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisite (optional)

If you want to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do) for this bridge automatically, you need to have enabled [Appservice Double Puppet](configuring-playbook-appservice-double-puppet.md) for this playbook.

For details about configuring Double Puppeting for this bridge, see the section below: [Set up Double Puppeting](#-set-up-double-puppeting)

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable the bridge, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_gmessages_enabled: true
```

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the bridge.

See [this section](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#extending-the-configuration) on the [common guide for configuring mautrix bridges](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md) for details about variables that you can customize and the bridge's default configuration, including [bridge permissions](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#configure-bridge-permissions-optional), [encryption support](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#enable-encryption-optional), [relay mode](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#enable-relay-mode-optional), [bot's username](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#setting-the-bot-s-username-optional), etc.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run it with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,ensure-matrix-users-created,start
```

**Notes**:

- The `ensure-matrix-users-created` playbook tag makes the playbook automatically create the bot's user account.

- The shortcut commands with the [`just` program](just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

  `just install-all` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly ([2x-5x faster](../CHANGELOG.md#2x-5x-performance-improvements-in-playbook-runtime) than `just setup-all`) when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just setup-all`, or these components will still remain installed.

## Usage

To use the bridge, you need to start a chat with `@gmessagesbot:example.com` (where `example.com` is your base domain, not the `matrix.` domain).

### 💡 Set up Double Puppeting

After successfully enabling bridging, you may wish to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do).

To set it up, you have 2 ways of going about it.

#### Method 1: automatically, by enabling Appservice Double Puppet

The bridge automatically performs Double Puppeting if [Appservice Double Puppet](configuring-playbook-appservice-double-puppet.md) service is configured and enabled on the server for this playbook.

This is the recommended way of setting up Double Puppeting, as it's easier to accomplish, works for all your users automatically, and has less of a chance of breaking in the future.

#### Method 2: manually, by asking each user to provide a working access token

When using this method, **each user** that wishes to enable Double Puppeting needs to follow the following steps:

- retrieve a Matrix access token for yourself. Refer to the documentation on [how to obtain one](obtaining-access-tokens.md).

- send the access token to the bot. Example: `login-matrix MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE`

- make sure you don't log out the `Mautrix-gmessages` device some time in the future, as that would break the Double Puppeting feature
