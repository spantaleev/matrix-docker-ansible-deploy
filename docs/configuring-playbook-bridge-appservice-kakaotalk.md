# Setting up Appservice Kakaotalk bridging (optional)

The playbook can install and configure [matrix-appservice-kakaotalk](https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk) for you. `matrix-appservice-kakaotalk` is a bridge to [Kakaotalk](https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/KakaoTalk?lang=ENG) based on [node-kakao](https://github.com/storycraft/node-kakao) (now unmaintained) and some [mautrix-facebook](https://github.com/mautrix/facebook) code.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: there have been recent reports (~2022-09-16) that **using this bridge may get your account banned**.

See the project's [documentation](https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk) to learn what it does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisite (optional)

If you want to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do) for this bridge automatically, you need to have enabled [Shared Secret Auth](configuring-playbook-shared-secret-auth.md) for this playbook.

For details about configuring Double Puppeting for this bridge, see the section below: [Set up Double Puppeting](#-set-up-double-puppeting)

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable the bridge, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_appservice_kakaotalk_enabled: true
```

You may optionally wish to add some [Additional configuration](#additional-configuration), or to [prepare for double-puppeting](#set-up-double-puppeting) before the initial installation.

### Additional configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the bridge.

Take a look at:

- `roles/custom/matrix-bridge-appservice-kakaotalk/defaults/main.yml` for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file
- `roles/custom/matrix-bridge-appservice-kakaotalk/templates/config.yaml.j2` for the bridge's default configuration. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `matrix_appservice_kakaotalk_configuration_extension_yaml` variable

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run it with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,ensure-matrix-users-created,start
```

**Notes**:

- The `ensure-matrix-users-created` playbook tag makes the playbook automatically create the bot's user account.

- The shortcut commands with the [`just` program](just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

  `just install-all` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just setup-all`, or these components will still remain installed.

## Usage

Start a chat with `@kakaotalkbot:example.com` (where `example.com` is your base domain, not the `matrix.` domain).

Send `login --save EMAIL_OR_PHONE_NUMBER` to the bridge bot to enable bridging for your Kakaotalk account. The `--save` flag may be omitted, if you'd rather not save your password.

### üí° Set up Double Puppeting

After successfully enabling bridging, you may wish to set up [Double Puppeting](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html) (hint: you most likely do).

To set it up, you have 2 ways of going about it.

#### Method 1: automatically, by enabling Shared Secret Auth

The bridge automatically performs Double Puppeting if [Shared Secret Auth](configuring-playbook-shared-secret-auth.md) service is configured and enabled on the server for this playbook.

This is the recommended way of setting up Double Puppeting, as it's easier to accomplish, works for all your users automatically, and has less of a chance of breaking in the future.

#### Method 2: manually, by asking each user to provide a working access token

When using this method, **each user** that wishes to enable Double Puppeting needs to follow the following steps:

- retrieve a Matrix access token for yourself. Refer to the documentation on [how to do that](obtaining-access-tokens.md).

- send the access token to the bot. Example: `login-matrix MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE`

- make sure you don't log out the `Appservice-Kakaotalk` device some time in the future, as that would break the Double Puppeting feature
