# Setting up Mautrix Instagram bridging (optional, deprecated)

<sup>Refer the common guide for configuring mautrix bridges: [Setting up a Generic Mautrix Bridge](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md)</sup>

**Note**: This bridge has been deprecated in favor of the [mautrix-meta](https://github.com/mautrix/meta) Messenger/Instagram bridge, which can be [installed using this playbook](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-meta-instagram.md). Consider using that bridge instead of this one.

The playbook can install and configure [mautrix-instagram](https://github.com/mautrix/instagram) for you.

See the project's [documentation](https://github.com/mautrix/instagram/blob/master/README.md) to learn what it does and why it might be useful to you.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable the bridge, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_instagram_enabled: true
```

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the bridge.

See [this section](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#extending-the-configuration) on the [common guide for configuring mautrix bridges](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md) for details about variables that you can customize and the bridge's default configuration, including [bridge permissions](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#configure-bridge-permissions-optional), [encryption support](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#enable-encryption-optional), [relay mode](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#enable-relay-mode-optional), [bot's username](configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-bridges.md#set-the-bots-username-optional), etc.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run it with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

The shortcut commands with the [`just` program](just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

`just install-all` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly ([2x-5x faster](../CHANGELOG.md#2x-5x-performance-improvements-in-playbook-runtime) than `just setup-all`) when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just setup-all`, or these components will still remain installed. Note these shortcuts run the `ensure-matrix-users-created` tag too.

## Usage

To use the bridge, you need to start a chat with `@instagrambot:example.com` (where `example.com` is your base domain, not the `matrix.` domain).

You then need to send `login YOUR_INSTAGRAM_EMAIL_ADDRESS YOUR_INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD` to the bridge bot to enable bridging for your instagram/Messenger account.

## Troubleshooting

As with all other services, you can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu matrix-mautrix-instagram`.

### Increase logging verbosity

The default logging level for this component is `WARNING`. If you want to increase the verbosity, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the playbook:

```yaml
matrix_mautrix_instagram_logging_level: DEBUG
```
