# Setting up MX Puppet Skype bridging (optional, removed)

The playbook used to be able to install and configure [mx-puppet-skype](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-skype), but no longer includes this component, because it has been broken and unmaintained for a long time.

Bridging to [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) can also happen via the [go-skype-bridge](configuring-playbook-bridge-go-skype-bridge.md) bridge supported by the playbook.
