# Setting up MX Puppet Skype bridging (optional, removed)

🪦 The playbook used to be able to install and configure [mx-puppet-skype](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-skype), but no longer includes this component, because it has been broken and unmaintained for a long time.

The playbook used to be able to install and configure [go-skype-bridge](configuring-playbook-bridge-go-skype-bridge.md) as alternative to this bridge, but no longer includes this component, because Skype has been discontinued since May 2025.
