# Setting up Cinny (optional)

This playbook can install the [Cinny](https://github.com/ajbura/cinny) Matrix web client for you.

Cinny is a web client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface. It can be installed alongside or instead of [Element Web](./configuring-playbook-client-element-web.md).

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: the latest version of Cinny is also available on the web, hosted by 3rd parties. If you trust giving your credentials to the following 3rd party Single Page Applications, you can consider using it from there and avoiding the (small) overhead of self-hosting:

- [app.cinny.in](https://app.cinny.in), hosted by the [Cinny](https://cinny.in/) developers


## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable Cinny, add the following configuration to your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
matrix_client_cinny_enabled: true
```

### Adjusting the Cinny URL

By default, this playbook installs Cinny on the `cinny.` subdomain (`cinny.example.com`) and requires you to [adjust your DNS records](#adjusting-dns-records).

By tweaking the `matrix_client_cinny_hostname` variable, you can easily make the service available at a **different hostname** than the default one.

While a `matrix_client_cinny_path_prefix` variable exists for tweaking the path-prefix, it's [not supported anymore](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/issues/3701), because Cinny requires an application rebuild (with a tweaked build config) to be functional under a custom path.

Example additional configuration for your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.example.com/vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Switch to a different domain (`app.example.com`) than the default one (`cinny.example.com`)
matrix_client_cinny_hostname: "app.{{ matrix_domain }}"
```

## Adjusting DNS records

Once you've decided on the domain, **you may need to adjust your DNS** records to point the Cinny domain to the Matrix server.

By default, you will need to create a CNAME record for `cinny`. See [Configuring DNS](configuring-dns.md) for details about DNS changes.

If you've adjusted `matrix_client_cinny_hostname`, you will need to adjust your DNS configuration accordingly.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook and [adjusting your DNS records](#adjusting-dns-records), run the playbook with [playbook tags](playbook-tags.md) as below:

<!-- NOTE: let this conservative command run (instead of install-all) to make it clear that failure of the command means something is clearly broken. -->
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

The shortcut commands with `just` program are also available: `just run-tags install-all,start` or `just run-tags setup-all,start`

`just run-tags install-all,start` is useful for maintaining your setup quickly when its components remain unchanged. If you adjust your `vars.yml` to remove other components, you'd need to run `just run-tags setup-all,start`, or these components will still remain installed. For more information about `just` shortcuts, take a look at this page: [Running `just` commands](just.md)
