# Setting up Appservice Webhooks (optional)

The playbook can install and configure [matrix-appservice-webhooks](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks) for you.

This bridge provides support for Slack-compatible webhooks.

Setup Instructions:

loosely based on [this](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks/blob/master/README.md)

1. All you basically need is to adjust your `inventory/host_vars/matrix.<domain-name>/vars.yml`:

```yaml
matrix_appservice_webhooks_enabled: true
matrix_appservice_webhooks_api_secret: '<your_secret>'
```

2. In case you want to change the verbosity of logging via `journalctl -fu matrix-appservice-webhooks.service`
you can adjust this in `inventory/host_vars/matrix.<domain-name>/vars.yml` as well.

*Note*: default value is: `info` and availabe log levels are : `info`, `verbose`

```yaml
matrix_appservice_webhooks_log_level: '<log_level>'
```

3. If you've already installed Matrix services using the playbook before, you'll need to re-run it (`--tags=setup-all,start`). If not, proceed with [configuring other playbook services](configuring-playbook.md) and then with [Installing](installing.md). Get back to this guide once ready.

4. If you're using the [Dimension Integration Manager](configuring-playbook-dimension.md), you can configure the Webhooks bridge by opening the Dimension integration manager -> Settings -> Bridges and selecting edit action for "Webhook Bridge". Press "Add self-hosted Bridge" button and populate "Provisioning URL"  & "Shared Secret" values from `/matrix/appservice-webhooks/config/config.yaml` file's homeserver URL value and provisioning secret value, respectively. 

5. Invite the bridge bot user to your room:

    - either with `/invite @_webhook:<domain.name>` (*Note*: Make sure you have administration permissions in your room)

    - or simply add the bridge bot to a private channel (personal channels imply you being an administrator)

6. Send a message to the bridge bot in order to receive a private message including the webhook link.
```
!webhook
```

7. The JSON body for posting messages will have to look like this:
```json
{
    "text": "Hello world!",
    "format": "plain",
    "displayName": "My Cool Webhook",
    "avatarUrl": "http://i.imgur.com/IDOBtEJ.png"
}
```

You can test this via curl like so:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{
"text": "Hello world!",
"format": "plain",
"displayName": "My Cool Webhook",
"avatarUrl": "http://i.imgur.com/IDOBtEJ.png"
}' \
<the link you've gotten in 5.>
```
