# Maintenance and Troubleshooting

## Maintenance

### How to back up the data on your server

We haven't documented this properly yet, but the general advice is to:

- back up Postgres by making a database dump. See [Backing up PostgreSQL](maintenance-postgres.md#backing-up-postgresql)

- back up all `/matrix` files, except for `/matrix/postgres/data` (you already have a dump) and `/matrix/postgres/data-auto-upgrade-backup` (this directory may exist and contain your old data if you've [performed a major Postgres upgrade](maintenance-postgres.md#upgrading-postgresql)).

You can later restore these by:

- Restoring the `/matrix` directory and files on the new server manually
- Following the instruction described on [Installing a server into which you'll import old data](installing.md#installing-a-server-into-which-youll-import-old-data)

If your server's IP address has changed, you may need to [set up DNS](configuring-dns.md) again.

### Remove unused Docker data

You can free some disk space from Docker by removing its unused data. See [docker system prune](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) for more information.

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=run-docker-prune
```

The shortcut command with `just` program is also available: `just run-tags run-docker-prune`

### Postgres

See the dedicated [PostgreSQL maintenance](maintenance-postgres.md) documentation page.

### Synapse

See the dedicated [Synapse maintenance](maintenance-synapse.md) documentation page.

## Troubleshooting

### How to see the current status of your services

You can check the status of your services by using `systemctl status`. Example:

```sh
sudo systemctl status matrix-synapse

‚óè matrix-synapse.service - Synapse server
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/matrix-synapse.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sun 2024-01-14 09:13:06 UTC; 1h 31min ago
```

### How to see the logs

Docker containers that the playbook configures are supervised by [systemd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd) and their logs are configured to go to [systemd-journald](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal).

For example, you can find the logs of `matrix-synapse` in `systemd-journald` by logging in to the server with SSH and running the command as below:

```sh
sudo journalctl -fu matrix-synapse
```

Available service names can be seen by doing `ls /etc/systemd/system/matrix*.service` on the server. Some services also log to files in `/matrix/*/data/..`, but we're slowly moving away from that.

We just simply delegate logging to journald and it takes care of persistence and expiring old data.

#### Enable systemd/journald logs persistence

On some distros, the journald logs are just in-memory and not persisted to disk.

Consult (and feel free to adjust) your distro's journald logging configuration in `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`.

To enable persistence and put some limits on how large the journal log files can become, adjust your configuration like this:

```ini
[Journal]
RuntimeMaxUse=200M
SystemMaxUse=1G
RateLimitInterval=0
RateLimitBurst=0
Storage=persistent
```

### How to check if services work

The playbook can perform a check to ensure that you've configured things correctly and that services are running.

To perform the check, run:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=self-check
```

The shortcut command with `just` program is also available: `just run-tags self-check`

If it's all green, everything is probably running correctly.

Besides this self-check, you can also check whether your server federates with the Matrix network by using the [Federation Tester](https://federationtester.matrix.org/) against your base domain (`example.com`), not the `matrix.example.com` subdomain.

#### In case of Matrix Federation API port not being able to be reached

Please note that some server providers block TCP/UDP ports which are not quite often used based on their judgment (in order to improve security, to mitigate the risk of abuse, etc). It can cause that your Matrix instance cannot be reached via Matrix Federation API port (`8448`), resulting in the error about federation when running self-check test.

In this case, make sure that your server provider does not block the port by default. As this playbook makes Docker configure the server's internal firewall for you as described [here](prerequisites.md), you mostly do not have to edit the firewall rules by yourself, unless your server is running behind another firewall.

If the provider was indeed found to disallow the port, you need to allow it explicitly on the server configuration for managing ports (control panel, etc), as it is not able for this playbook to update the upstream configuration. Please consult the documentation of the provider for details about it.

### How to debug or force SSL certificate renewal

SSL certificates are managed automatically by the [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) reverse-proxy server.

If you're having trouble with SSL certificate renewal, check the Traefik logs (`journalctl -fu matrix-traefik`).

If you're [using your own webserver](configuring-playbook-own-webserver.md) instead of the integrated one (Traefik), you should investigate in another way.
